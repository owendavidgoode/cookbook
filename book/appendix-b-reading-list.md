# Appendix B: A Reading List

Fifty posts worth reading, curated from 5,233.

This list draws from the longest posts, the most cross-disciplinary, the signature topics, and the interviews. It is not comprehensive—nothing could be—but it provides entry points across the blog's seventeen-year range.

All posts are available at johndcook.com/blog.

## How to Use This List

This list represents roughly 1% of the archive. It favors longer posts, which tend to be more developed, and posts that span categories, which tend to be more unusual.

For any specific topic—quaternions, continued fractions, Unicode, orbital mechanics—search the blog directly. The archive is searchable at johndcook.com/blog, and seventeen years of posts mean that most mathematical and computational topics have been touched at least once.

The interviews are particularly recommended as entry points. They reveal both the subjects' thinking and the interviewer's interests—what he chose to ask, where he pushed for detail, what connections he noticed.

For readers who want to follow the blog's evolution, reading chronologically from 2008 is illuminating. The early posts are shorter and more scattered; the recent posts are longer and more focused. Watching the transformation unfold gives a sense of intellectual development that no single post can provide.

## A Note on Selection

Any list of fifty posts from 5,233 involves judgment calls. These selections favor:

- Length (longer posts generally contain more developed arguments)
- Cross-disciplinarity (posts spanning categories are rarer and often more interesting)
- Signature topics (pi, primes, gamma, Fourier—the recurring obsessions)
- Interviews (the only posts featuring other voices)

A different curator would choose different posts. The archive is deep enough to support many valid reading lists. This one provides starting points; the exploration is up to the reader.
