Temporal patterns are autobiography written in timestamps. Every post carries a date and time. Aggregate 5,233 of them and a portrait appears of when one person does his thinking.

## The Weekly Shape

Tuesday is the peak.

| Day | Posts | % |
|-----|-------|---|
| Tuesday | 1,003 | 19.2% |
| Wednesday | 938 | 17.9% |
| Monday | 887 | 17.0% |
| Thursday | 823 | 15.7% |
| Friday | 561 | 10.7% |
| Saturday | 555 | 10.6% |
| Sunday | 466 | 8.9% |

The week has a clear arc. Activity rises from Monday through Tuesday, holds through Wednesday, then falls through the weekend. Friday sees a notable drop—down to 10.7%, barely more than Saturday. By Sunday, posting reaches its minimum.

The weekday-to-weekend ratio is 4.13:1. For every post that appears on Saturday or Sunday, more than four appear Monday through Friday.

The shape isn't a hobbyist's pattern. A hobbyist—someone who blogs in their spare time, after work and on weekends—would show the opposite shape: peaks on Saturday and Sunday, valleys during the workweek. The data shows a professional's schedule: blogging is part of the work, and work happens on workdays.

But why Tuesday? Why not Monday, the fresh-start day? Why not Friday, when the week's thoughts have accumulated?

The data alone doesn't explain it. But a plausible story: Monday is for meetings, email, catching up on what accumulated over the weekend. Tuesday is the first day clear enough for sustained thought. The blog posts that appear on Tuesday may be written on Tuesday, or they may be the refined versions of thoughts that began on Monday and crystallized overnight. Either way, Tuesday is when the typing happens.

## The Daily Shape

The hourly distribution tells a clearer story:

| Hour | Posts | % |
|------|-------|---|
| 7:00 AM | 683 | 13.1% |
| 8:00 AM | 580 | 11.1% |
| 6:00 AM | 501 | 9.6% |
| 9:00 AM | 503 | 9.6% |
| 10:00 AM | 323 | 6.2% |
| 11:00 AM | 315 | 6.0% |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 3:00 PM | 194 | 3.7% |
| 6:00 PM | 139 | 2.7% |
| 11:00 PM | 19 | 0.4% |

This is a morning person.

Nearly 44% of all posts appear between 6:00 AM and 10:00 AM. The peak hour is 7:00 AM, with 683 posts—more than one in eight. Add the 6:00 AM hour and more than one in five posts appears before most people have finished breakfast.

After 10:00 AM, the numbers decline steadily through the afternoon. There's a minor uptick in the early evening (7:00-8:00 PM), perhaps representing thoughts that percolated during the day and demanded expression before bed. But the pattern is unmistakable: the blog is written in the morning.

This aligns with conventional wisdom about creative work. The morning brain, rested and not yet depleted by decisions, handles complex thought better than the afternoon brain. Writers from Hemingway to Toni Morrison have described the morning as their productive window. The timestamps confirm that Cook follows the same pattern—whether consciously or not.

The timestamps appear to be in Central Time, consistent with Cook's location in Houston. A 7:00 AM post is genuinely early—not an artifact of timezone conversion.

## The Yearly Shape

Monthly distribution reveals something unexpected: nothing.

| Month | Posts | % |
|-------|-------|---|
| October | 480 | 9.2% |
| November | 478 | 9.1% |
| January | 469 | 9.0% |
| September | 448 | 8.6% |
| February | 444 | 8.5% |
| August | 438 | 8.4% |
| March | 436 | 8.3% |
| July | 410 | 7.8% |
| April | 406 | 7.8% |
| December | 417 | 8.0% |
| June | 413 | 7.9% |
| May | 394 | 7.5% |

The range from highest (October, 9.2%) to lowest (May, 7.5%) is less than two percentage points. This is flat.

For comparison, consider what seasonal patterns typically look like. Academic blogs peak during semesters and crater in summer. News blogs spike during election seasons. Personal blogs often show holiday gaps. Most human activities have seasonal rhythms—productivity rises in autumn, slumps in late summer, crashes in December.

The blog shows none of this. October and January are essentially tied for the lead. May and July are essentially tied for the rear. The difference is statistical noise.

This flatness is remarkable. It suggests either extreme discipline (posting regardless of season) or complete integration (the blog doesn't compete with other activities that have seasonal patterns). Most likely it's both: a practice so embedded in daily routine that it neither competes with vacations nor depends on semesters.

## The Trajectory

Combine quantity and depth into a single picture: plot posts per year against average word count per year, and trace the path from 2008 to 2025.

[FIGURE: Connected scatterplot showing posts vs. average length by year, with years labeled, showing trajectory from high-volume/short to moderate-volume/longer]

The story this tells is not simple.

2008 begins in the upper-left corner: 410 posts, average length 206 words. Many short posts. The blog is establishing itself, finding its voice, casting about.

The trajectory then moves roughly down and to the right through 2014—fewer posts, but not necessarily longer ones. The 2014 point is the nadir: only 147 posts, average length just 188 words. Whatever happened that year, it produced less of everything.

Then the path turns. From 2015 onward, the trajectory moves up and to the right: more posts *and* longer posts. By 2022, the blog publishes 362 posts averaging 476 words—the high point for average length.

The most recent years (2023-2025) cluster near 350-400 posts with averages around 435 words. The blog has found its mature rhythm: roughly one post per day, roughly 400-450 words per post.

The shape of the trajectory—down-and-right, then up-and-right—suggests not a trade-off but an evolution. The early years were finding the form. The middle years were a transition. The recent years represent a practiced capacity to produce more, at higher quality, without apparent strain.

## Consistency Within Years

How steady is the monthly rhythm within each year?

One way to measure: the coefficient of variation (CV), which is the standard deviation divided by the mean. A low CV means even distribution across months; a high CV means lumpy distribution.

| Year | Monthly CV |
|------|------------|
| 2010 | 0.14 |
| 2020 | 0.14 |
| 2008 | 0.19 |
| 2014 | 0.16 |
| 2017 | 0.20 |
| 2022 | 0.39 |
| 2015 | 0.38 |

Most years show CVs between 0.14 and 0.30—moderately even distribution. The blog doesn't have months that receive five times as many posts as others. The rhythm, while not metronomic, is steady.

The exceptions are interesting. 2022, despite being a strong year overall (362 posts), shows the highest variation (CV of 0.39). Some months got significantly more attention than others. 2015, a transitional year as the blog emerged from its 2014 dip, also shows high variation—the rhythm was unsettled.

But these are exceptions. The baseline pattern is consistency: month after month, year after year, the posts keep coming at roughly the same pace.

## Reading the Rhythm

Three patterns emerge from the temporal data.

**First: professional schedule.** The weekday dominance and morning concentration suggest that blogging is not carved out of personal time but integrated into work time. It's not "I write when I get home from my real job"; it's "writing is part of my real job."

**Second: internal rhythm.** The flat seasonal distribution suggests the blog runs on an internal clock, not an external calendar. Academic years don't shape it. Holidays don't disrupt it. The practice is autonomous.

**Third: evolved capacity.** The trajectory from 2008 to 2025 shows not a trade-off between quantity and quality but a growth in both. More posts *and* longer posts. The mature blog outproduces the young blog on both axes.

## The Anti-Pattern

Cook wrote in 2024: "I've never had a schedule for this blog: I write when I feel like writing."

This statement, in light of the data, requires careful interpretation. He has no schedule in the sense of "I will publish every Tuesday and Thursday at 9:00 AM." The timestamps vary; the specific days vary; there's no visible automation.

But he has a profound rhythm in the sense of "I write most mornings, most weeks, most months, year after year." The absence of an external schedule doesn't mean the absence of a pattern. It means the pattern is internal—habitual rather than calendared, felt rather than planned.

The data reveals a mind that shows up. Not every day, but most days. Not at the same minute, but in the same window. Not according to seasons or semesters or news cycles, but according to its own steady pulse.

Seven o'clock in the morning, usually Tuesday, regardless of month: that's when the writing happens.
