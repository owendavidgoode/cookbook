The blog isn't only math.

At the center, yes—2,378 posts in the Math category, 45% of everything. But the edges tell another story. Music (85 posts). Typography (50). Clinical trials (55). Unicode (72). These are not mathematical categories by any standard definition. Still, they persist, year after year, for seventeen years.

What does a mathematician do when he's not doing math? The edges reveal the person.

## Music: 85 Posts

The first music post appeared July 23, 2008: "Michael Brecker," a brief tribute to the jazz saxophonist. It's not mathematical at all—just an appreciation.

But by October 2009, music had become a mathematical topic: "Circle of fifths and number theory." The question is concrete: why can you cycle through all twelve notes of the chromatic scale by going up by fifths, but not by thirds or sixths? The answer involves modular arithmetic and the fact that 7 (the number of semitones in a fifth) is coprime to 12.

This is the pattern throughout. Music posts begin with a musical observation and arrive at mathematics:

- "Logarithms, music, and arsenic" (2008): Why musical intervals are measured in logarithms
- "Mathematics and piano tuning" (2022): The compromises of equal temperament
- "How many musical scales are there?" (2017): Counting with combinatorics
- "The acoustics of kettledrums" (2016): Bessel functions in drumheads
- "Dividing an octave into 14 pieces" (2022): Alternative temperaments

Nineteen posts carry both the Math and Music categories. These are the intersection points, where the two interests don't just coexist but merge:

- "Circle of fifths and roots of two" (2009)
- "Perfect fifths, octaves, and an ergodic map" (2021)
- "Overtones and Barbershop Quartets" (2025)
- "Equipentatonic scale" (2025)

The mathematical content is real. Bessel functions describe vibrating circular membranes (drumheads). The overtone series is a Fourier decomposition. Equal temperament is a compromise between irrational and rational numbers—you can't have both perfect fifths and perfect octaves using the same tuning system.

Music appears because it can't not appear. The mathematics of sound, scale, and rhythm is too rich to ignore. A mathematician who plays or listens to music will eventually notice the structure.

## Typography: 50 Posts

A mathematician who cares how symbols look.

Typography is about the visual representation of text: fonts, spacing, rendering, encoding. It's not traditionally part of mathematics, though mathematicians write formulas and care about their appearance.

The blog's typography posts cluster in the early years:

| Period | Typography Posts |
|--------|-----------------|
| 2008-2012 | 24 |
| 2013-2017 | 8 |
| 2018-2025 | 18 |

The early burst makes sense: Cook was establishing workflows, learning tools, sharing discoveries. "Accented letters in HTML, TeX, and MS Word" (2008) documents how to type ü and é across platforms—basic but constantly needed.

Later posts dig deeper:

- "Typesetting music with LilyPond" (2009): Where typography meets music
- "Typesetting 'C#' in LaTeX" (2011): The sharp symbol has peculiar rendering
- "Double-struck capital letters" (2023): The ℕ and ℝ of mathematical notation

The typography interest connects to precision. A mathematician who writes carefully about formulas will notice when the formula looks wrong. And a blogger who types thousands of posts will accumulate knowledge about character encoding, font rendering, and the quirks of different systems.

## Clinical Trials: 55 Posts (2008-2018)

This category has a sharp edge: it ends.

| Year | Clinical Trial Posts |
|------|---------------------|
| 2008 | 24 |
| 2009 | 6 |
| 2010 | 6 |
| 2011 | 2 |
| 2012 | 6 |
| 2013 | 1 |
| 2014 | 1 |
| 2015 | 5 |
| 2016 | 3 |
| 2018 | 1 |
| 2019-2025 | 0 |

Twenty-four posts in 2008—the launch year energy, but also clearly a professional focus. Then steady engagement through 2016. Then a final post in 2018. Then nothing.

The titles reveal practical work:

- "Cohort assignments in clinical trials" (2008)
- "Stopping trials of ineffective drugs earlier" (2008)
- "Bayesian adaptive clinical trials: promise and pitfalls" (2016)

This is applied statistics in medicine: how to design experiments that test drugs efficiently and ethically. The posts suggest someone working in pharmaceutical statistics, facing real design problems, writing about them.

Then it stops. The counts don't explain why. A career change? A change in what can be discussed publicly? The closure of one professional chapter and the opening of another?

The clinical trials category is the blog's most clearly professional territory, and its disappearance is the blog's most visible career transition. Whatever happened in 2018, it left a clean break in the data.

## Unicode: 72 Posts

An unexpected obsession.

Unicode is the standard for encoding text across languages and symbol systems. It specifies how computers represent everything from Latin letters to Chinese characters to mathematical symbols to emoji.

72 posts tag Unicode—more than Music or Typography. And the posts span the entire blog:

| Period | Unicode Posts |
|--------|--------------|
| 2008-2012 | 11 |
| 2013-2017 | 7 |
| 2018-2022 | 37 |
| 2023-2025 | 17 |

The intensity increased over time. The recent era has more than three times as many Unicode posts as the early era.

Why? Several threads converge:

- Mathematical symbols live in Unicode. Writing about ∞ and ∑ and ∈ means understanding their encodings.
- International text processing requires Unicode. Anyone working with real-world data encounters encoding issues.
- Unicode is peculiar. It has a double-struck capital letters (𝔸, 𝔹, 𝕔), math alphabets, invisible characters, combining marks. A curious mind finds corners to explore.

Sample posts:
- "Unicode arrows: math versus emoji" (2022)
- "Unicode to LaTeX" (2013)
- "Unicode spaces" (2020)

The Unicode interest sits at the intersection of computing and precision. You can't write mathematics on computers without understanding how computers represent mathematical symbols. You can't process text reliably without understanding encoding. Unicode is infrastructure—usually invisible, but occasionally demanding attention.

## The Geography of Curiosity

30 posts carry the Geography category. These are mathematical explorations with spatial flavor:

- "Zip codes, geocodes, and Hilbert curves" (2022): Space-filling curves for spatial indexing
- "State abbreviations as a random walk" (2018): Visualizing abbreviation patterns
- "Generating random points in Colorado" (2025): Uniform sampling within arbitrary boundaries

Geography posts are sparse but persistent. They represent another edge where mathematics meets the physical world.

## What the Edges Reveal

The edge categories share a pattern: they're not mathematics, but they involve mathematics.

Music involves frequencies, ratios, combinatorics. Typography involves encoding, rendering, visual precision. Clinical trials involve experimental design, Bayesian statistics, optimization. Unicode involves discrete structures, internationalization, edge cases.

The blog doesn't have a category for "pure hobbies"—no posts about sports, cooking, or travel as ends in themselves. The edges are edges of the mathematical map, not departures from it. They're places where mathematical thinking applies to non-mathematical domains.

This suggests something about the author's intellectual style: everything becomes a math problem. Hear a piece of music? Wonder about the frequency ratios. Encounter a character encoding issue? Investigate the standard. Design a clinical trial? Apply optimal stopping theory.

The edges aren't distractions from the center. They're extensions of it.

## The Clinical Trial Mystery

One edge is different: clinical trials.

Music persists for seventeen years. Typography persists. Unicode intensifies. But clinical trials end—cleanly, completely, in 2018.

The blog doesn't explain the break. There's no farewell post, no "I'm moving on from clinical work." The topic simply stops appearing. The silence is more eloquent than any explanation.

Career transitions leave traces in the data. The clinical trials arc traces a professional identity: someone working in pharmaceutical statistics from 2008 through 2018, then not. The work continues elsewhere, presumably, but not on the blog.

This is what edges can reveal: not just interests but their boundaries. Music has no boundary—it runs from 2008 to 2025. Clinical trials have a sharp one. The difference tells a story about which interests are personal (music) and which were professional (clinical work).

## Humanization Through Data

The edges humanize the center.

A blog that was purely mathematical would be abstract, impersonal, a textbook in slow motion. The edges reveal a person: someone who listens to music, cares about fonts, worked in clinical statistics, and notices the details of character encoding.

The outline posed a question: "What does a mathematician do when he's not doing math?"

The answer from the data: he finds math in everything else. The edges of the map are not departures from mathematics but applications of it to domains mathematics doesn't usually claim. Music, typography, geography, encoding—all become mathematical when a mathematical mind engages with them.

The blog's edges are not escapes from the center. They're expeditions from it—and they always return.
