# Prologue

5,233 posts.

Let that number sit for a moment. 5,233 posts over more than seventeen years—roughly one every 1.25 days, from January 2008 through November 2025. No breaks. No sabbaticals. No pivots to video, no podcast spinoffs, no Substack migration. Just a mathematician writing about what interested him, day after day, for nearly two decades.

The blog launched in January 2008—the same year the iPhone App Store opened, the same year Twitter was still asking "what are you doing?" instead of optimizing for engagement. The internet of 2008 was a different place. People still had blogrolls. Google Reader still existed. The idea that an individual could build something meaningful by simply showing up and writing—no algorithm, no growth hacks, no content strategy—was not yet quaint.

While the internet reinvented itself three times over, johndcook.com kept doing one thing. Math. Computing. Statistics. The occasional digression into music theory or typography or the curious properties of Unicode. No ads. Comments that were once active have since been removed, likely after spam and moderation overhead grew out of control. No viral moments. No controversy. No brand.

The blog appears in university syllabi at MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and dozens of smaller schools. It's cited in academic papers. Its code snippets run in production systems at companies John D. Cook has never heard of. When a programmer searches "gamma function python" at 2am, trying to debug something urgent, they find him. When a graduate student needs an intuitive explanation of Bayesian inference, they find him. When someone wants to know why the Fourier transform matters, or how to think about prime numbers, or what makes a good random number generator, they find him.

This is influence without fame. Infrastructure without brand. The blog doesn't trend. It doesn't go viral. It just *answers questions*, year after year, and the answers accumulate.

1.8 million words. The equivalent of eighteen novels. All free, all public, all still there.

What does it mean to do one thing for seventeen years?

The internet doesn't reward persistence. It rewards novelty, outrage, timing. The algorithms that govern what we see are optimized for engagement, which means they're optimized for emotion, which means they're optimized for the new and the inflammatory. A blog that publishes careful explanations of mathematical functions cannot compete with this. It doesn't try.

Still, the blog persists. Not because it games any system, but because it's genuinely useful. Because when you need to understand something, you don't want engagement—you want clarity. John D. Cook has been providing clarity since before the word "content" replaced the word "writing."

There's a term for this in ecology: a climax species, the organism that remains after the initial colonizers have come and gone, after the boom-and-bust cycles have played out, after the ecosystem has stabilized. The internet's climax species are not the viral sensations. They're the quiet sites that just keep being useful.

This book is an attempt to see the shape of that persistence.

Not by reading every post—though many were read—but by counting, measuring, and visualizing. How many posts about prime numbers? (103.) What day does he publish most? (Tuesday.) How has the average post length changed over seventeen years? (It doubled.) When did cryptography become a major topic? (2019, and there's a story there.)

The data reveals patterns. The patterns suggest stories. The stories, taken together, form something like a portrait—not of a person, but of a practice. A way of showing up. A way of thinking in public.

This is not a biography. John D. Cook's personal life is not the subject; it's barely mentioned on the blog itself. This is something more specific: a data portrait of one person's intellectual output over seventeen years. It asks, in effect, what it looks like when someone just *keeps going*.

A few things this book is not:

It's not comprehensive. 5,233 posts cannot be summarized. The chapters that follow trace patterns and highlights, peaks and outliers, but most posts go unmentioned.

It's not evaluative. The goal is not to rank posts or declare favorites. The data can show which entries are longest, most tagged, most cross-disciplinary—but not which are most valuable. That belongs to readers.

It's not authorized. John D. Cook didn't commission this book. He may not know it exists until it reaches him. It is a gift, made from public data, offered in appreciation.

What it is: an experiment in seeing. Can a body of work be understood from above? Can numbers and charts reveal something that reading alone would miss?

The answer is yes—but only partially. The data shows structure. The structure suggests meaning. But meaning itself lives somewhere the numbers can't reach. The final chapter of this book will acknowledge this. For now, the story begins with what can be measured.

More than seventeen years. 5,233 posts. 1.8 million words. One voice, steady and curious, writing into the void and finding that the void was full of people who needed exactly what he had to offer.

This is the shape of that work.
