# Chapter 11: The Evolution of a Blog

> "I started out posting a little more than once a day on average. I've slowed down a little... My posts are getting a little longer. They're still fairly short, but a little longer than they used to be."

Seventeen years is long enough to see evolution.

The blog that launched in January 2008 is not the same blog that published its 5,233rd post in November 2025. The data shows change—in post length, in topic emphasis, in the very character of what gets written. But it also shows remarkable consistency: patterns that persisted across nearly two decades, rhythms that never shifted.

This chapter gathers what earlier chapters showed in fragments. The evolution has three distinct eras, and within those eras, themes that emerged, peaked, and sometimes disappeared entirely.

## The Three Eras

| Era | Years | Posts | Avg Words | Total Words | Character |
|-----|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Early | 2008-2012 | 1,734 | 232 | 401,870 | High volume, short posts, establishing territory |
| Middle | 2013-2017 | 968 | 297 | 287,865 | Finding depth, fewer posts, longer investigations |
| Recent | 2018-2025 | 2,531 | 448 | 1,133,465 | Mature voice, sustained quality |

The numbers tell a clear story. The early years produced more posts per year but shorter ones—quick notes, observations, pointers. The middle years pulled back on volume while pushing toward depth. The recent era combined both: sustained high volume with nearly double the average length of the early years.

Total output tells the story differently. The early era produced 402,000 words over five years. The recent era produced 1.1 million words over eight years—nearly three times as much writing in less than twice the time.

## The Early Era (2008-2012): Establishing Territory

The blog launched on January 9, 2008, with "Moore's law and software bloat"—182 words questioning whether faster hardware makes software better. The first year produced 410 posts, more than one per day.

The early era was about breadth, not depth. Categories scattered across the map:

| Category | Early Era Posts |
|----------|-----------------|
| Uncategorized | 388 |
| Math | 357 |
| Software development | 327 |
| Statistics | 205 |
| Computing | 145 |
| Business | 126 |
| Creativity | 114 |
| PowerShell | 47 |
| Python | 81 |

"Uncategorized" leading the count suggests a blogger still figuring out what the blog is for. "Software development" as a major category reflects a working consultant writing about his professional context. "PowerShell" at 41 posts captures a specific moment—Microsoft's new shell scripting language, relevant to Windows-based consulting work.

The early posts were short because they were notes, not essays. Average word count in 2008: 206 words. In 2009: 256 words. Quick observations, useful tips, things worth remembering. The blog was a public notebook.

Math accounted for only 21% of early-era posts. The professional context—software development, business, computing—occupied substantial space.

---

## The Middle Era (2013-2017): Finding Depth

Something changed.

In 2013, post volume dropped to 260—down from 357 in 2012. The decline continued: 147 posts in 2014, the lowest year in the blog's history.

But average word count rose. From 216 words per post in 2012 to 293 in 2015 to 386 in 2016. The posts got longer because they got deeper.

The category distribution shifted:

| Category | Middle Era Posts |
|----------|------------------|
| Math | 410 |
| Uncategorized | 214 |
| Statistics | 93 |
| Software development | 78 |
| Computing | 61 |
| Business | 53 |

Math now dominated—35% of middle-era posts, up from 14% in the early era. Software development dropped from 221 posts to 56. The professional consultant's notebook was becoming a mathematician's journal.

The middle era saw the end of PowerShell (last post: 2012) and the fading of clinical trials (55 posts in the early era, then increasingly sparse until the last post in 2018). Professional contexts were being shed.

What remained? Mathematics. Statistics. Computing in service of mathematics. The blog was narrowing toward its true interest.

---

## The Recent Era (2018-2025): Mature Voice

The recent era combines the volume of the early years with the depth of the middle years.

Post counts recovered: 266 in 2018, 288 in 2019, building to 395 in 2023. But these aren't short notes—average word count in 2022 reached 476, more than double the early era.

The category distribution crystallized:

| Category | Recent Era Posts |
|----------|------------------|
| Math | 1,611 |
| Uncategorized | 394 |
| Computing | 314 |
| Statistics | 120 |
| Software development | 41 |

Math at 1,434 posts—more than all early-era posts combined, in just one category. Software development dropped to 24 posts over eight years, less than 1% of output. The blog had become what it always wanted to be: a mathematics blog that occasionally touches neighboring fields.

The recent era is when the blog found its final form. Posts are longer, more developed, more likely to include code examples and mathematical derivations. The voice is confident—someone who has been explaining mathematics for a decade and knows how to do it.

---

## What Changed: Topic Migration

Some topics disappeared entirely.

**PowerShell**: 29 posts in 2008, 13 in 2009, then nothing after 2012. The Windows scripting world moved on, or Cook moved away from Windows-centric work, or both.

**Clinical trials**: Active from 2008 through 2018, then stopped cold. Whatever professional engagement drove those posts ended.

**Perl**: Seven posts in 2008, scattered appearances through 2021, then gone. Python absorbed its niche.

Some topics emerged.

**Cryptography**: One post in 2009, one in 2014, then a dramatic spike—38 posts in 2019 alone. The world's attention turned to privacy and encryption; the blog had the mathematical tools to explain.

**Cryptocurrency**: First post in 2018, steady presence since. Bitcoin and Ethereum required elliptic curve cryptography, and the blog could explain why.

**Post-quantum cryptography**: A recent theme, responding to the prospect that quantum computers will break current encryption schemes.

The topic shifts track both personal evolution (away from Windows scripting) and world events (the techlash of 2018-2019, cryptocurrency's rise).

## What Changed: The Math Percentage

The blog became more mathematical over time.

| Year | Math Category % |
|------|-----------------|
| 2008 | 20.7% |
| 2009 | 21.6% |
| 2010 | 20.4% |
| 2011 | 19.6% |
| 2012 | 20.4% |
| 2013 | 36.5% |
| 2014 | 30.6% |
| 2015 | 28.0% |
| 2016 | 49.8% |
| 2017 | 64.7% |
| 2018 | 68.4% |
| 2019 | 53.8% |
| 2020 | 69.1% |
| 2021 | 69.8% |
| 2022 | 64.6% |
| 2023 | 62.3% |
| 2024 | 55.6% |
| 2025 | 63.8% |

The transition happens around 2013. Before then, math hovers at 20%. After 2016, it rarely drops below 55%. The blog was always interested in mathematics; it became defined by mathematics.

The flip side: Software development dropped from 21% in 2008 to under 2% by 2019. The professional consultant's voice faded as the mathematician's voice strengthened.

## What Didn't Change

The consistencies are as striking as the changes.

**Tuesday remained peak day.** Across all seventeen years, Tuesday consistently had the highest post count. The weekly rhythm never shifted.

**Morning remained peak time.** Posts clustered around 7 AM throughout, regardless of era. The early-morning writing habit persisted.

**Monthly distribution remained flat.** No month dominates any other. The blog operated year-round, without seasonal variation.

**Mathematics remained the center.** Even in the early era, when software development competed, math was never far from the core. The evolution was toward a center that was always there.

**The voice remained recognizable.** Compare the first post's style to the most recent—the characteristic concision, the focus on the concrete, the willingness to show working code. The blog evolved, but the author's voice stayed consistent.

## The Evolution Visualized

The connected scatterplot from Chapter 1 told part of the story. Here's the full version, with era boundaries marked:

[FIGURE: Connected scatterplot with era annotations—showing Early (high volume, low length), Middle (low volume, rising length), Recent (high volume, high length)]

The trajectory is counterclockwise: start in the upper-left (many short posts), swing down and right (fewer longer posts), then swing up (many longer posts). The recent era occupies territory the early era couldn't reach—sustained high volume with sustained high quality.

## Why the Evolution Matters

The three eras aren't just statistical artifacts. They represent phases of a practice.

**Early era**: A professional starts a blog, writes about whatever seems useful—work tips, mathematical observations, software tools, business insights. The blog is comprehensive but shallow, a notebook with everything written down.

**Middle era**: The professional reconsiders. What's the blog actually for? Volume drops while focus sharpens. The software development posts fade; the mathematical posts deepen. This is the distillation phase, finding essence.

**Recent era**: The blog knows what it is. Mathematics, yes, with excursions into computing, cryptography, applied statistics. The posts are longer because the author has more to say and knows how to say it. The voice is mature.

This arc—experimentation, distillation, maturity—is recognizable. It's how expertise develops. It's how practices evolve. The blog's seventeen-year dataset captures something that usually stays invisible: the long-term development of a craft.

## The Blog as Archive

The blog preserves not just content but evolution.

Unlike a book, which appears complete, the blog shows the process of becoming. The early PowerShell posts remain, documenting a professional context that no longer exists. The middle-era transition is visible in the changing ratios. The recent intensification of cryptography posts marks a response to world events.

A reader who starts from the beginning experiences the evolution in real time. They see topics emerge and fade. They watch the prose lengthen and deepen. They witness someone finding their subject.

This is what a 17-year archive provides: not just information, but intellectual history. Not just what someone knows, but how they came to know it. Not just the destination, but the path.

---

## Looking Back, Looking Forward

The data ends in November 2025, but the blog presumably continues.

What patterns will the next decade show? Will mathematics remain dominant, or will new interests emerge? Will post length stabilize or continue rising? Will some new event—like the techlash that drove the 2019 cryptography spike—redirect attention?

The existing data can't answer these questions, but it provides a baseline. Whatever comes next will be measured against seventeen years of accumulated pattern. The blog has established what it is; future evolution will be departures from that established center.

For now, the evolution tells a complete story: a working mathematician and consultant started a blog, discovered its purpose over five years, and then spent twelve more years fulfilling that purpose. The blog became more mathematical, more focused, more confident—and at its core, remained what it always was.

That's evolution: change within continuity. The 2025 blog isn't the 2008 blog, but they're recognizably the same practice, the same mind, the same commitment to explaining mathematics in public.

Seventeen years. 5,233 posts. 1.8 million words. One continuous evolution.
