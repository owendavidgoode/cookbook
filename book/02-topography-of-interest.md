# Chapter 2: The Topography of Interest

> "Cohomology does not itself solve hard problems... It clears away tangled multitudes of individually trivial problems. It puts the hard problems in clear relief and makes their solution possible."

The blog has categories. WordPress requires it—you cannot publish a post without assigning it to at least one category. Many bloggers treat this as a chore, clicking the obvious option and moving on.

Cook has twenty-six categories. Taken together, they form a map of his mind.

## The Overwhelming Center

Math: 2,378 posts. Forty-five percent of everything.

Not "mathematics," which would sound academic. Not "maths," which would sound British. Just "Math"—the working term, the doing word. And it dominates the blog like nothing else dominates anything.

To visualize the proportions: if the blog were a country, Math would be the territory west of the Mississippi. Everything else would share the East.

[FIGURE: Treemap of all categories showing Math's visual dominance at 45.4%]

The second-largest category is "Uncategorized" at 996 posts (19%). We'll return to this mystery. For now, note that the largest *named* category after Math is Computing at 520 posts (9.9%)—less than a quarter of Math's size.

Here is the full breakdown:

| Category | Posts | % of Total |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Math | 2,378 | 45.4% |
| Uncategorized | 996 | 19.0% |
| Computing | 520 | 9.9% |
| Software development | 446 | 8.5% |
| Statistics | 418 | 8.0% |
| Science | 231 | 4.4% |
| Business | 206 | 3.9% |
| Python | 177 | 3.4% |
| Creativity | 161 | 3.1% |
| Music | 85 | 1.6% |
| Clinical trials | 55 | 1.1% |
| Typography | 50 | 1.0% |
| PowerShell | 47 | 0.9% |
| Graphics | 43 | 0.8% |
| Geography | 30 | 0.6% |
| Machine learning | 24 | 0.5% |
| AI | 16 | 0.3% |
| Algorithms | 15 | 0.3% |
| (8 more minor categories) | ... | <0.2% each |

## What Kind of Math?

"Math" is a big tent. The posts within it span everything from recreational puzzles to graduate-level analysis. The tags within Math posts reveal the internal structure:

The top ten tags in Math posts:
1. Number theory (267 posts)
2. Probability and Statistics (250)
3. Special functions (134)
4. Differential equations (124)
5. Geometry (103)
6. Complex analysis (90)
7. Cryptography (79)
8. Numerical analysis (64)
9. Integration (57)
10. Linear algebra (55)

Number theory leads—the study of integers, primes, divisibility, the atoms of arithmetic. This is the purest of pure mathematics, the branch G. H. Hardy famously defended as having "no practical applications" (a claim now disproven by cryptography). That it leads the tags suggests Cook's heart lies with fundamentals.

But look at the mix that follows: probability, differential equations, numerical analysis. It is not the pure mathematician's curriculum; it's the applied mathematician's toolkit—the math that solves problems, that runs in code, that makes predictions. The blog sits at the intersection of rigor and utility.

## The Practical Layer

Below Math in the hierarchy sits a cluster of practical categories:

- **Computing** (520 posts, 9.9%)
- **Software development** (446 posts, 8.5%)
- **Statistics** (418 posts, 8.0%)

Together these constitute more than a quarter of the blog. They overlap with Math frequently—91 posts carry both Computing and Math categories, 56 share Math and Statistics—but they signal a distinct audience: people who write code, build systems, analyze data.

The Computing category covers implementation: how to make computers do things. The Software development category covers practice: how to organize the making. The Statistics category covers inference: how to extract knowledge from data.

Notice what's absent from this practical layer: trendy buzzwords. "Machine learning" has only 24 posts. "AI" has only 16. The blog predates the 2012 deep learning revolution, and while it occasionally touches on neural networks and language models, it doesn't chase the hype cycle. The practical layer is timeless practical—shell scripting and probability distributions, not prompt engineering.

## The Surprising Corners

The small categories reveal more than the large ones.

**Music** (85 posts, 1.6%): A mathematician writing about music is not unusual—the fields share a fascination with pattern and structure. But 85 posts is significant. These aren't casual mentions; they're sustained investigations. "Circle of fifths and number theory." "The acoustics of kettledrums." "How many musical scales are there?" Nineteen of the Music posts also carry the Math category. When Cook writes about music, he's doing mathematics.

**Typography** (50 posts, 1.0%): An unexpected obsession. Posts about accented letters in HTML, typesetting music notation, LaTeX commands for obscure symbols, the rendering of double-struck capital letters. These are not mathematical topics by any standard definition. But they reveal something about the author: a care for how symbols appear on the page, a precision that extends beyond content to presentation.

**Clinical trials** (55 posts, 1.1%): This category has a strange shape. The posts span 2008-2018, then stop. Completely. Not a gradual fade—a hard cut. Something happened in 2018. A career shift? A change in professional focus? The data doesn't say. But the pattern is visible: ten years of writing about clinical trial design, Bayesian adaptive methods, cohort assignments—and then nothing. A closed chapter.

**Geography** (30 posts, 0.6%): Small but persistent. "Zip codes, geocodes, and Hilbert curves." "State abbreviations as a random walk." The spatial imagination of a mathematician applied to maps and territories.

## The Uncategorized Mystery

996 posts escape the author's own taxonomy. Nearly one in five.

What are they? A sample reveals the pattern: they're not any one thing. They're everything else.

- "Productivity advice from Mark Twain" — a quote, filed nowhere
- "AI Spring" — a brief observation without sustained analysis
- "Breach Safe Harbor" — privacy commentary that doesn't fit Computing
- "Example of memorizing a 256-bit private key" — cryptography crossed with memory techniques
- "Impulse response" — differential equations, but not quite Math

The Uncategorized category is a miscellany bin. It holds 464 posts with no tags at all—thoughts that arrived without classification. It holds cross-disciplinary observations that span boundaries. It holds brief pointers and links.

But its size suggests something deeper: the limits of any taxonomy. Twenty-six categories cannot capture the full range of a working mind. When the thoughts don't fit, Cook publishes them anyway. The "Uncategorized" posts are evidence of intellectual activity that resists sorting—the overflow of curiosity.

---

## The Overlaps

621 posts carry multiple categories. These intersections map the author's mental geography.

The top five combinations:
1. Computing + Math (98 posts)
2. Math + Statistics (64)
3. Math + Python (58)
4. Math + Science (37)
5. Math + Software development (34)

Math is the hub. Almost every significant combination includes it. The blog's network structure is a star topology with Math at the center.

But some combinations are unexpected:

- **Math + Music** (19 posts): Where scales become ratios and harmonics become Fourier series. "The opening chord of 'A Hard Day's Night'" analyzed mathematically. "Mathematics and piano tuning."

- **Clinical trials + Statistics** (22 posts): The professional overlap, where Bayesian methods meet drug development.

- **Business + Software development** (26 posts): Where technical skill meets organizational reality. Consulting, project management, the human side of technical work.

- **Geography + Math** (15 posts): Where maps become mathematical objects. Coordinate systems, projection problems, geocoding algorithms.

The overlaps reveal what the single categories miss: a mind that doesn't respect disciplinary boundaries. The blog is not a math blog that occasionally mentions code, nor a coding blog that occasionally invokes math. It lives in the intersection permanently.

## Evolution of the Territory

The categories are not static. Their proportions shift over the seventeen years.

Math has grown both in absolute and relative terms:
- 2008: 85 posts (21% of that year's output)
- 2012: 73 posts (20%)
- 2016: 104 posts (50%)
- 2020: 199 posts (69%)
- 2024: 138 posts (56%)

The blog has become more mathematical over time. What began as a balanced mix tilted toward Math's dominance, especially after 2016.

Meanwhile, Statistics has declined:
- 2008: 81 posts
- 2012: 33 posts
- 2020: 10 posts
- 2024: 16 posts

This may reflect career changes. The clinical trials category died in 2018; Statistics, its close companion, faded with it. The professional statistician's work shifted, and the blog's categories followed.

Python as a category shows another pattern:
- 2008: 10 posts
- 2012: 23 posts
- 2016: 10 posts
- 2020: 5 posts

The Python category peaked in the early 2010s and declined—not because Python posts stopped, but because Python became so embedded in Math and Computing that separate categorization seemed redundant. The tag "Python" appears in 83 Math posts; the language has been absorbed into the mathematical practice itself.

## Reading the Categories

A taxonomy is a theory of what matters. When Cook created twenty-six categories, he made twenty-six claims about the structure of his own interests. When he assigned posts to those categories, he made thousands of small judgments about what goes where.

The resulting map has features:

**A single dominant territory.** Math is not first among equals; it's an empire. Everything else exists in relation to it. The blog could almost be called "Math and its applications to everything."

**A practical belt around the center.** Computing, Software development, Statistics—these surround Math and connect it to the working world. They're not peripheral; they're infrastructure.

**Small holdings at the edges.** Music, Typography, Geography—tiny territories that persist year after year. Not big enough to shape the whole, but present enough to signal their importance.

**A large unclaimed wilderness.** Nearly a fifth of the blog escapes categorization. The taxonomy is incomplete by design, or by necessity.

This is what a mathematician's mind looks like when laid out in categories: one overwhelming center, a practical ring, scattered outposts of curiosity, and a significant portion that refuses to be mapped.

## Beneath the Map

The outline for this chapter posed a question: "What does a mathematician's mind organize itself around?"

The category data offers an answer: around mathematics, but not only mathematics. Around the intersection of rigor and application. Around sustained curiosities that persist for decades. Around the willingness to write about whatever proves interesting, whether or not it fits.

The topography is not neat. It's not the curriculum of an academic department or the hierarchy of a library's Dewey Decimal system. It is one person's working map of what matters, updated over seventeen years, with all the irregularity that implies.

Cook once quoted a passage about category theory in mathematics: it "clears away tangled multitudes of individually trivial problems" and "puts the hard problems in clear relief." The blog's own categories do something similar. They clear away the question of what this blog is *about* and put the real structure in relief.

It's about math. It's about making math work. It's about everything that touches math when you're not being too careful about boundaries.

The twenty-sixth category—Uncategorized—is the most honest one. The mind that wrote this blog does not fully fit its own taxonomy.
