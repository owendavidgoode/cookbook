# Chapter 12: What the Numbers Miss

This book is built on counting.

5,233 posts. 26 categories. 1.8 million words. The numbers form a scaffold that supports everything else—the patterns, the eras, the evolutions, the spikes and fades. Without the counts, there's no story to tell.

But some things don't count.

## The Uncountable

How many systems run code copied from this blog?

When a developer at 2 AM finds a post about the gamma function, understands finally what it does, and adapts the code for production—there's no metric for that. No download counter, no citation index, no way to trace the influence.

The blog has been a quiet presence in scientific computing for seventeen years. It explains special functions that standard documentation assumes you already know. It provides Python snippets for operations that should be obvious but aren't. It bridges the gap between mathematical definition and working code.

How many graduate students have that one post bookmarked? How many production systems contain a line adapted from an example here? How many hours of confusion has the blog prevented?

No number answers these questions. The influence is real but unmeasured—infrastructure without metrics.

## The Shortest Posts

The data captures everything, including the minimal.

| Words | Title |
|-------|-------|
| 5 | "Music recommendations" |
| 7 | "Synchronizing metronomes" |
| 9 | "New prime number record" |
| 9 | "PowerShell A-Z series completed" |
| 10 | "Introduction to computer virtualization" |
| 11 | "Simple interpolation" |
| 12 | "Technology hype curve" |
| 12 | "Getting started with SciPy (Scientific Python)" |

232 posts under 50 words. 696 posts under 100 words. These are announcements, links, pointers—a sentence or two directing attention elsewhere.

The data counts them equally. Each gets one entry in the post count, one contribution to the total. But their function is different: not explanation but curation, not teaching but pointing.

Did "Music recommendations" (5 words) influence anyone? Probably, if the link was good. But the influence came from elsewhere; the post was a conduit, not a source.

## The Single-Use Tags

79 tags appear exactly once in the entire archive.

Sage. Leadership. CSS. Decision theory. Neuroplasticity. Debugging. Etymology. Coq. Java. R. Agile. Humor.

Each represents a curiosity that didn't recur. Cook encountered Sage (the mathematical software), wrote one post, moved on. He wrote about leadership once—probably prompted by something specific, now forgotten. He mentioned Java exactly once in seventeen years.

The single-use tags form a long tail of momentary interests. They document what almost became a theme but didn't. They're the roads not taken, visible only because the tagging system preserved them.

What determines whether a curiosity becomes a recurring topic or stays a one-off? The data shows the outcomes but not the process. Why 25 posts about elliptic curves but only one about R (the statistics language)? Why persistent engagement with Mathematica but a single mention of Sage?

The decisions happened in a mind, not a dataset.

## The Deleted Comments

For years, blog posts accumulated comments—readers asking questions, correcting errors, extending arguments, sharing their own experiences. The comment sections were conversations, not monologues.

Eventually, the comments disappeared.

The archive now presents posts without their original discussion threads. Whatever insights readers contributed, whatever corrections they offered, whatever questions they asked—gone. The blog as it exists today is Cook's voice only, without the chorus that once responded.

Why remove the comments? The tables don't explain. The blog itself suggests that spam volume and moderation overhead were non‑trivial, and it's plausible that managing spam, along with a desire for a cleaner archive, played a role. The reasons matter less than the result: a record that preserves the author's words but not the community's responses.

What's missing? No way to know. The comment sections are not archived, not recoverable, not part of the 1.8 million words we can count.

## The Posts That Mattered Most

Which posts had the most impact?

The data offers proxies. Longest posts, perhaps—the Atiyah interview at 1,926 words might matter more than "Music recommendations" at 5 words. Most-tagged posts, maybe—a post with seven tags touches more topics than one with two.

But these proxies miss the point. Impact happens in readers, not in metadata.

A 200-word post that finally clarifies the difference between the gamma function and the factorial might change how someone thinks forever. A 1,000-word post that covers familiar ground might change nothing. The word count can't distinguish.

The posts that mattered most are probably not the longest, not the most tagged, not the ones with "comprehensive" or "introduction" in the title. They're the ones that reached someone at the right moment—when they needed exactly that explanation, exactly that code snippet, exactly that connection between fields.

Those posts are invisible in the data. They're known only to the readers whose understanding they changed.

## The 2 AM Debugging Sessions

The blog's traffic patterns aren't in this dataset—we have posts, not pageviews. But anyone who has worked in technical fields knows the pattern.

It's 2 AM. Something is broken. You've been debugging for hours. You google a function name and land on a blog post that explains exactly what you need.

This happens constantly, across technical blogs, Stack Overflow answers, GitHub documentation. The blog participates in this ecosystem: a resource consulted in moments of need, forgotten the next day, but crucial in that moment.

How many 2 AM debugging sessions has this blog resolved? The number would be meaningful—it would measure real value, real hours saved, real problems solved. But it's unknowable. The search happens in private; the relief goes unrecorded.

## The Influence on Students

Graduate students read blogs differently than professionals.

A working engineer needs an answer: how do I compute this, fix this, implement this? A graduate student needs understanding: what is this, why does it matter, how does it connect to what I already know?

The blog serves both, but the student's debt is harder to measure. A professional might copy a code snippet and forget the source. A student might internalize an explanation and carry it forward for decades—teaching it to their own students, building on it in their own research, using it as a foundation that they no longer consciously trace.

Academic citations occasionally capture this influence. But most learning isn't cited. Most foundational understanding comes from sources that never appear in bibliographies. A blog post that shaped how someone thinks about special functions might influence papers that never mention it.

## The Territory vs. the Map

This book has drawn a map.

5,233 posts become patterns: topic distributions, temporal rhythms, evolutionary arcs. The patterns suggest a person: someone who writes about mathematics, prefers Tuesday mornings, deepened over time. The map is useful.

But the territory is larger.

The territory includes every reader who learned something. Every system running adapted code. Every student who understood finally. Every debugging session resolved. Every connection between fields that became visible because someone took the time to explain.

The territory includes the comment sections that no longer exist, the influences that were never counted, the changes in understanding that left no trace.

The territory includes the person behind the posts—the one who decided what to write, who chose examples and metaphors, who found simple ways to explain difficult things. The data shows the output; the mind that produced it remains opaque.

## Why This Book Exists Anyway

If the numbers miss so much, why count at all?

Because patterns suggest stories. Because stories suggest a person. Because even incomplete maps are useful.

The statistics in this book don't capture the blog's full influence. They can't measure impact, can't count understanding, can't trace the paths from post to production code. But they reveal structure: what topics recur, how the blog evolved, what rhythms persisted, what changed.

That structure tells us something about seventeen years of intellectual work. Not everything—but something.

A mathematician starts a blog. He writes about what interests him: special functions, number theory, programming languages, cryptography, music, typography, clinical trials. Some topics fade; others intensify. The posts get longer, deeper, more focused. A voice develops—concise, example-driven, bridge-building between fields.

The numbers capture the shape of this evolution. They can't capture the meaning, the influence, the lives touched or problems solved. But they can show that something happened here—something sustained, something coherent, something worth documenting.

## The Limits of Quantification

Every chapter in this book has included statistics. Post counts, word counts, category distributions, temporal patterns. The numbers provide evidence for claims about the blog's character and evolution.

But this chapter has no visualizations. Deliberately.

Some things resist quantification. The influence of a good explanation can't be graphed. The value of a 2 AM debugging session can't be tabulated. The long-term shaping of how someone thinks about mathematics—that's not a metric.

The data-heavy chapters earned the right to this data-free one. Having counted everything countable, the text can finally acknowledge what counting misses.

## What Remains

The blog continues. New posts appear; the archive grows. The patterns documented here will shift—new topics will emerge, old ones will fade, the evolution will continue.

Readers will continue to find posts in moments of need. Students will continue to learn from explanations they'll never cite. Code will continue to flow from blog to production without acknowledgment.

The numbers will grow: 6,000 posts someday, then 7,000. The word count will pass 2 million. New topics will appear in the category distribution; old topics will fade further.

And the influence will remain unmeasured. The territory will remain larger than the map.

That's fine. Maps don't need to be complete to be useful. This one shows the shape of seventeen years of mathematical writing—the rhythms, the emphases, the evolution. It doesn't show everything; it shows enough.

The rest belongs to the readers who found what they needed, exactly when they needed it, and never thought to say thanks.
