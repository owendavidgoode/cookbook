---

## Audience

| Priority | Audience | Assumption |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Primary | John D. Cook | Knows his own blog. Gift recipient. |
| Secondary | His readers | Know the blog, will buy when he posts about it. |
| Tertiary | Data viz / blogging enthusiasts | May not know the blog, drawn by the craft. |

**Implication:** Write it *to* John, let others overhear. Don't over-explain the blog or who he is.

## Style Guide

| Item | Decision |
|------|----------|
| Name reference | "Cook" mostly, "John" occasionally for warmth |
| Post citations | "Title" (year) — e.g., "Interview with Sir Michael Atiyah" (2013) |
| HTML entities | Clean to readable characters (&#8217; → ') |
| Notes | Endnotes per chapter, used sparingly—for asides that would break flow |
| Technical level | One clause of context max, woven in, never condescending |
| Numbers | Spell out 1-10, numerals 11+, always numerals for data, commas in thousands |
| Voice | Pure narrative, third person, no direct address, author invisible |

**Technical explanations example:**
> "The gamma function—the mathematical tool that extends factorials beyond whole numbers—appears in 18 posts, spanning the blog's entire history."

One clause of context, keeps moving, trusts the reader.

## Visual Design

| Element | Decision |
|---------|----------|
| Page size | 7" × 10" |
| Color | Full color interior |
| Text layout | Single column, ragged right |
| Visualizations | Mixed: full page for major, half page for supporting |
| Chapter openers | Pull quote from the blog, then visuals where they make sense |
| Pull quotes | Quote card style, used for rhythm throughout |
| Margins | Generous—gift book, not dense reference |

**Visualization note:** Current sampler (book/visual_sampler_v2/) demonstrates capabilities but is not finalized. All charts will be regenerated with final data and refined styling.
