The blog mentions Gauss sixteen times. Euler ten times. Ramanujan ten times. These aren't citations in the academic sense—no formal references, no page numbers, no concern for scholarly protocol. They're something more interesting: relationships.

When a working mathematician invokes a historical figure by name, they're positioning themselves. Here is Gauss, who proved this theorem. Here is how the result is used. Here is the conversation across centuries.

## The Giants

**Gauss: 16 posts (2009-2025)**

Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) was called the "Prince of Mathematicians." He contributed to number theory, algebra, statistics, analysis, differential geometry, geophysics, optics, and electrostatics. The Gaussian distribution, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, Gaussian elimination, Gaussian curvature—his name attaches to fundamental objects across mathematics.

The blog's Gauss posts reflect this breadth:

- "An integral theorem of Gauss" (2025)
- "Curvature: principal, Gauss, and mean" (2023)
- "Gauss's lemma for quadratic residues" (2014)

Gauss appears when the topic is geometry, when it's number theory, when it's statistics. He's the universal ancestor, the figure whose work touches everything.

**Euler: 10 posts (2012-2025)**

Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) was the most prolific mathematician in history. He published roughly 900 papers and books, and his collected works fill over 80 volumes. The letter *e* for Euler's number, the Greek letter Σ for summation, the notation f(x) for functions—Euler standardized the language of mathematics.

The blog invokes Euler for computational matters:

- "Computing the Euler-Mascheroni Constant" (2025)
- "Euler's formula for dual numbers and double numbers" (2025)
- "Euler characteristic with dice" (2012)

Euler's prolificacy resonates with the blog's own project: steady output, across years, contributing to the permanent record.

## The Intuitive Genius

**Ramanujan: 10 posts (2011-2024)**

Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) was self-taught, growing up in India with limited access to the mathematical literature of his time. He independently discovered thousands of results, some already known and some startlingly new. G. H. Hardy, who brought Ramanujan to Cambridge, described some of his formulas as so strange that no one could have invented them—they must be true because no one would have the imagination to fake them.

The blog returns to Ramanujan repeatedly:

- "Ramanujan's master theorem" (2024)
- "Error in Ramanujan's approximation for ellipse perimeter" (2024)
- "Partition numbers and Ramanujan's approximation" (2018)
- "Ramanujan approximation for circumference of an ellipse" (2013)
- "Ramanujan's most beautiful identity" (2012)
- "Ramanujan pi approximation" (2012)
- "Ramanujan's nested radical" (2013)

The word "approximation" appears in five of these titles. Ramanujan had an uncanny ability to find simple formulas that approximate complex quantities. The ellipse perimeter approximation—accurate to O(λ^10)—is practically exact for any ellipse you'd encounter in engineering. The pi approximation gives 18 correct decimal places from a formula involving only roots and fractions.

Hardy called one of Ramanujan's results "most beautiful." Cook quotes this phrase, then admits: "If I understood it, I might say it's beautiful, but for now I can only say it's mysterious." This humility before the dead genius characterizes the blog's treatment: not hagiography, but genuine engagement with difficult material.

## The Connector

**Paul Erdős: 7 posts (2009-2025)**

Paul Erdős (1913-1996) was mathematics' legendary wanderer—homeless by choice, living out of a suitcase, traveling from collaborator to collaborator for sixty years. He coauthored papers with more than 500 people. The "Erdős number" measures collaborative distance from him: if you wrote a paper with Erdős, your number is 1; if you wrote with someone who wrote with Erdős, your number is 2; and so on.

The blog engages both with Erdős's mathematics and his mythology:

- "A triangle inequality by Erdős" (2025)
- "Erdős-Mordell triangle theorem" (2025)
- "Solution to a problem of Erdős" (2024)
- "An elegant proof from Erdős" (2011)
- "Six degrees of Paul Erdős" (2009)

The "Six degrees" post is about the Erdős number itself—the mathematical version of the Kevin Bacon game. The others are about Erdős's actual theorems, which often have the character of elementary-sounding problems with non-trivial solutions. A triangle inequality from 1935. A result about isosceles triangles solved in 2024.

Erdős believed that God kept a book of the best proofs—"THE BOOK." The highest compliment for a proof was that it came "from the book." The blog quotes this notion when discussing Euclid's proof of infinite primes. The idea recurs: mathematics has quality, proofs can be elegant or ugly, and the goal is to find the good ones.

## The Bridge Builder

**Donald Knuth: 6 posts (2010-2025)**

Donald Knuth (born 1938) is still alive—unlike the other mathematicians on this list. He's famous for *The Art of Computer Programming*, a multi-volume work that bridges mathematics and computing. He invented TeX (for typesetting) and METAFONT (for font design). He's both a mathematician and a computer scientist, equally at home with algorithm analysis and with the kerning of letters.

The blog's Knuth posts:

- "Variations on Knuth's Twindragon" (2025)
- "Knuth's Twindragon" (2025)
- "Knuth's series for chi squared" (2014)
- "Random sample from permutation cycles" (2010)

Knuth connects the blog's mathematical interests to its computational interests. The Twindragon is a fractal, visually striking but also mathematically precise. The chi-squared series is statistical. Knuth moves between domains—exactly as the blog does.

## The Supporting Cast

**Newton: 11 posts (2009-2025)**

Isaac Newton (1643-1727) needs no introduction, though the blog rarely introduces him. Newton appears in titles when the topic is Newton's method (for finding roots) or Newtonian mechanics:

- "Mollweide map projection and Newton's method" (2025)
- "A Continental Divide for Newton's Method" (2025)

Newton's method is a workhorse algorithm, still used after three centuries. The blog treats it as a tool, not an artifact.

**Fourier: 20 posts (2011-2023)**

Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) appears so often partly because "Fourier transform" is such a common phrase. The posts are usually about the transform, not the person. Still, Fourier's name attached to his method ensures he's invoked constantly in signal processing, heat transfer, and quantum mechanics.

**Laplace: 12 posts (2011-2024)**

Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827), like Fourier, is invoked mainly through the transform that bears his name. "Laplace transform inversion theorems" is about method, not biography.

**Riemann: 7 posts (2012-2025)**

Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) appears through the zeta function and through Riemannian geometry. The Riemann hypothesis—that the zeta function's non-trivial zeros lie on a specific line—is one of mathematics' great unsolved problems. The blog approaches it with appropriate caution:

- "Brownian motion and Riemann zeta" (2025)
- "Mellin transform and Riemann zeta" (2024)

No claim to solve the hypothesis. Just connections, explorations, tools.

**Cauchy: 5 posts (2008-2024)**

Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) contributed to analysis, complex analysis, and physics. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, Cauchy sequences, Cauchy's integral formula. The blog invokes Cauchy when precision matters:

- "The Cauchy distribution's counter-intuitive behavior" (2024)
- "Reversed Cauchy-Schwarz inequality" (2021)

**Hilbert: 5 posts (2013-2022)**

David Hilbert (1862-1943) was the last mathematician to know all of mathematics. His 23 problems, posed in 1900, shaped the field for a century. The blog mentions Hilbert curves—space-filling curves useful for data indexing and geocoding:

- "Zip codes, geocodes, and Hilbert curves" (2022)

Practical application of deep theory.

**Fermat: 8 posts (2011-2025)**

Pierre de Fermat (1607-1665) is famous for his "last theorem," proved only in 1995. The blog's Fermat posts engage with number theory:

- "Fermat primes and tangent numbers" (2025)
- "Fermat curve" (2023)

Fermat remains relevant to modern cryptography and computational number theory.

## What the Names Reveal

When Cook invokes a historical mathematician, what's happening?

Sometimes it's attribution: "Ramanujan discovered this approximation." Sometimes it's positioning: "this is in the tradition of Gauss." Sometimes it's simply naming: "the Laplace transform," "Hilbert space," "Euler's formula."

But always it's connection. The blog exists in a tradition. The problems it engages have histories. The theorems it explains bear names because people discovered them, often centuries ago, and those people deserve recognition.

The mathematicians who appear most often are not random. Gauss, Euler, Ramanujan, Newton—these are figures whose work spans domains. They contribute to number theory *and* physics *and* statistics. They're universal mathematicians, and the blog, which refuses to stay in one domain, naturally encounters them everywhere.

## Living with Giants

How does a working mathematician relate to the dead giants?

Not as a historian, reconstructing original contexts and intellectual environments. Not as a biographer, exploring personal lives and motivations. But as a user—someone who needs the theorems, uses the tools, stands on the shoulders.

The blog's relationship to Gauss is functional: here's what he proved, here's how it helps. The relationship to Ramanujan is more tinged with wonder: here's what he discovered, here's why it's mysterious. The relationship to Erdős is collegial: here's a problem he posed, here's a proof he liked.

These relationships are not reverent in a religious sense. The blog doesn't treat Euler as a saint to be venerated. But there's respect—an acknowledgment that the field has a history, that good ideas deserve credit, that mathematics is a conversation across centuries.

To work in a field with 2,000 years of history is to be constantly reminded that others came before. The named theorems, the named functions, the named constants—they're all someone's contribution, someone's insight, someone's gift to the future.

The blog participates in that tradition. Not by discovering new theorems (though Cook has published academic work), but by explaining old ones. By connecting them. By making them accessible.

And every time a post mentions Gauss or Ramanujan or Erdős, it acknowledges: the work does not start from scratch. It builds on what they built. That's how mathematics works.
