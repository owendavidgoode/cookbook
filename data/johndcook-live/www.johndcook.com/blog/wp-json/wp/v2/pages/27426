We can&#8217;t know what a particular customer will buy, when a particular computer will crash, or exactly where the next gold deposit will be. But we can know what a kind of customer is likely to buy, about how many computers will crash this month, and the most promising place to dig for gold.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Probability<\/strong> gives us a way to <strong>proceed rationally in the face of uncertainty<\/strong>. It allows us to make the best decisions we can, given what we know and don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>Some events are truly random. Others, though not random, are so chaotic or hard to predict that it&#8217;s convenient to think of them as if they are random. Probability (specifically Bayesian analysis) gives us a way of treating different sources of uncertainty in a unified manner.<\/p>\n<h2>Communicating probability<\/h2>\n<p>Probability is subtle, and people often need to make decisions involving probability even though they don&#8217;t understand the mathematics involved. Lawyers have to make arguments based on probability that a randomly selected group of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johndcook.com\/blog\/expert-testimony\/\">jurors<\/a> will understand. Corporate boards need to make decisions involving probability; failure to take uncertainty into account can be very costly.<\/p>\n<p>We have years of experience explaining ideas from probability to laymen in such a way that they can make intelligent decisions without having to plumb the mathematical depths of probability.<\/p>\n<h2>Problem solving experience<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve helped many businesses solve probability problems. Clients have wanted to know things like how reliable a data storage procedure is, how long it should take to catch a spammer, and which treatments are most likely to treat cancer effectively. We&#8217;ve helped clients evaluate investments, design medical devices, and plan marketing campaigns. All these problems boil down to probability.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to finding probability problems for business, we also <strong>explain <\/strong>the solutions in terms that decision makers can understand. (A solution that no one understands well enough to act on doesn&#8217;t do any good.) Some clients come to us just for explanation. For example, a medical device manufacturer asked us to explain to their sales team what the medical literature had to say about their product. They needed to understand probabilities in a way they could confidently convey to their customers.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 100px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/\/www.johndcook.com\/lester_circle_g.jpg\" alt=\"A.
