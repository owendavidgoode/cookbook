You might want to reduce it, or if that&#8217;s not possible, you might want to shift some of its spectrum to where it is less noticeable.<\/p>\n<p>If we&#8217;re talking about literal noise, this is one of the primary tasks of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johndcook.com\/blog\/psychoacoustics-consulting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">psychoacoustics<\/a>, but there are many cases where we&#8217;re interested in reducing &#8220;noise&#8221; in the more general sense of unwanted randomness.<\/p>\n<h2>Deliberately adding noise<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes, rather than filter out noise, you might want to <em>add<\/em> noise into a system that doesn&#8217;t have enough noise because, counter-intuitively, noise can sometimes make a system more reliable. For example, sometimes a little noise can get a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johndcook.com\/blog\/applied-kalman-filtering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kalman filter<\/a> unstuck.

This is where John excels: just the right mix of practical urgency with mathematical rigor.
