A US federal comprehensive privacy law, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johndcook.com\/blog\/apra\/\">APRA<\/a>, has been proposed recently; we&#8217;ll see what becomes of it.<\/p>\n<p>There are also state laws such as California&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johndcook.com\/blog\/ccpa\/\">CCPA<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johndcook.com\/blog\/tdpsa\/\">TDPSA<\/a> in Texas, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johndcook.com\/blog\/illinois-bipa\/\">Illinois&#8217; Biometric Information Privacy Act<\/a>. The various state laws are somewhat repetitive, though these three have unique features.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with legal experts to understand and satisfy your regulatory requirements.<\/p>\n<h2>Unstructured data<\/h2>\n<p>Unstructured data\u2014free text, audio files, video, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johndcook.com\/blog\/2023\/11\/17\/dicom\/\">DICOM images<\/a>, etc.\u2014is not really unstructured but rather has a non-relational structure that makes it harder to analyze and harder to deidentify. We have experience working with medical images, audio dictation, social media, and other forms of non-relational data, specifying and certifying procedures for deidentifying such data while retaining its business value.<\/p>\n<h2>Expert PhD signoff<\/h2>\n<p>We are data privacy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johndcook.com\/blog\/data-privacy-sme\/\">subject matter experts<\/a>.
