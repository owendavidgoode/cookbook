					<description><![CDATA[What a nice post, everything in one place. How does it work for steradia, that is, tetrahedra from a sphere&#039;s center to a triangle on it&#039;s surface? Does the sphere need to be a sphere, or can the surface triangle be over any closed continuous solid when the tetrahedra do not cross the surface twice?

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Unfortunately, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission essentially prohibits the construction of profitable nuclear reactors.&quot;

I&#039;m afraid that there is no such thing as a &quot;profitable nuclear reactor&quot;. Not a single one is insured against the risks of a nuclear accident, which should tell you something about the economics of nuclear power. And it&#039;s getting worse with massive cost overruns for the latest newly-built reactors (Okiluoto, Hinkley Point C, etc.).]]></description>

double the triangle so that you get a parallelogram with sides a and b, and diagonals 2m=c and 2h=d, then:  2a^2 + 2b^2 = c^2 + d^2, which can be worded as: the sum of the squares on the *four* sides of a parallelogram equals the sum of the squares on its *two* diagonals.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The cross ratio is a  concrete representation of the statement:

The moduli space  of four _distinct_ marked points on the projective line   P^1  is P^1 - {0, 1, ∞}.  

The &quot;missing&quot; points correspond to so called  stable rational curves. Rather than to  a line with 3 points they correspond to a configuration of _two_ lines, each with marked points glued in a particular way (IIRC 0 1, ∞  (resp 0&#039;. 1&#039;. ∞&#039;)   where either 0&#039;, 1&#039;, or ∞&#039;  is glued on the other line at 1).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since,  987,654,321 equals 1,000,000,000 - 123,456,789, we can also conclude that:
1,000,000,000 / 123,456,789 in base 10 equals ~8.1
10,000,000 / 1,234,567 in base 8 equals ~6.1
... and so forth.

Alternatively,
10 / 81 in base 10 returns value 0.123,456,790,123,...
10 / 61 in base 8 returns 0.123,457,012,3...
10 / E1 in base 16 returns 0.123,456,789,abc,df0,123,...

By the way, 81 is 9^2, 61 (or 49 in base 10) is 7^2, and E1 (225 in base 10) is 15^2.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s actually a generalization of Pythagoras in two different ways. As well as the one shown here, you can take the original right triangle and draw the mediant line from the right-angled vertex. Since a right-angled triangle can be inscribed in a circle, we have h=m=c/2 and so Apollonius says a^2 + b^2 = 2(c^2/4+c^2/4) = c^2.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is often convenient to switch back and forth between ln (log base e) and lg (log base 2). This can be done using ln(2) about 0.69314718056. Thus 0.7 is good to 99%. In fact, almost exactly 99%, and ln(2) is 7 * 99 / 1000 = 0.693 is right to about 0.01%. 

The big advantage with the natural log is of course that ln(1 + x) is about x, or x - x^2/2 using the standard power series, and a similar expansion for ln(1 - x).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[8.0000000729 looks an awful lot like it&#039;s 8 + 9^3/10^10, which suggests a conjecture that

num(b) / denom(b) ~ (b-2) + (b-1)^3 / b^b.

and similarly, for example in base 9 we have num(9) / denom(9) = 7.000000628, in base 8 we have num(8) / denom(8) = 6.00000527, etc.  (In base b, (b-1)^3 has the digits (b-3), 2, (b-1).)

In fact num(b) = ((b^b*(b-2) + 1)/(b-1)^2 and denom(b) = (b^b - b^2 + b - 1)/(b-1)^2.   These are A051846 and A023811 in the OEIS, respectively; I would have done the algebra but I looked them up there.

Straightforward algebra shows that num(b) - (b-2) denom(b) = b-1, from which

num(b) / denom(b) = (b-2) + (b-1)^3 / (b^b - b^2 + b - 1)

which is our conjecture with some low-order terms in the denominator.]]></description>

<p>and similarly, for example in base 9 we have num(9) / denom(9) = 7.000000628, in base 8 we have num(8) / denom(8) = 6.00000527, etc.  (In base b, (b-1)^3 has the digits (b-3), 2, (b-1).)</p>
<p>In fact num(b) = ((b^b*(b-2) + 1)/(b-1)^2 and denom(b) = (b^b &#8211; b^2 + b &#8211; 1)/(b-1)^2.   These are A051846 and A023811 in the OEIS, respectively; I would have done the algebra but I looked them up there.</p>
<p>Straightforward algebra shows that num(b) &#8211; (b-2) denom(b) = b-1, from which</p>
<p>num(b) / denom(b) = (b-2) + (b-1)^3 / (b^b &#8211; b^2 + b &#8211; 1)</p>
<p>which is our conjecture with some low-order terms in the denominator.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The best way I can think of to put it is that AI coding assistants make bad programmers worse and good programmers way more productive. 

In other words, if you could have written the code yourself, using the assistant will let you do so much, much faster by automating many things with you still in the loop for design, review and approval. 

But if you don&#039;t have any domain knowledge, the AI coding assistant isn&#039;t going to provide that on its own and leaving it to vibe code will give you a never ending headache of bugs and security issues.

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking of mental math, I just read your post on tetrahedral numbers https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/05/30/stacking-cannonballs/ 

Without pencil or paper, I realized that if you allow negative tetrahedral numbers, 17 can be written as the sum of 4 with a much simpler se5t of numbers than the one you posted: 17 = T(4,3)+T(-3,3)+T(-3,3)+T(-3,3) (20, -1, -1, -1)

I told my daughter about negative tetrahedral numbers, and she almost immediately found another combination of 4 that add up to 17, then a combination of 3 that does, too:

17 = T(3,3)+T(2,3)+T(2,3)+T(-3,3) (10, 4, 4, -1)
17  = T(4,3)+T(-4,3)+T(1,3) (20, -4, 1)]]></description>
