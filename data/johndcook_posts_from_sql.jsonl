So how can two polynomials be perpendicular to each other? In geometry, two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product of their coordinates is zero. In more general settings, two things are said to be orthogonal if their inner product (generalization of dot product) is zero. So what was a <em>theorem</em> in basic geometry is taken as a <em>definition</em> in other settings. Typically mathematicians say “orthogonal” rather than “perpendicular.” The basic idea of lines meeting at right angles acts as a reliable guide to intuition in more general settings.rnrnTwo polynomials are orthogonal if their inner product is zero. You can define an inner product for two functions by integrating their product, sometimes with a weighting function.rnrnOrthogonal polynomials have remarkable properties that are easy to prove.

Sweave embeds R code inside LaTeX and replaces the code with the result of running the code, much like web development languages such as PHP embed code inside HTML.rnrnSweave is often launched from an interactive R session, but this can defeat the whole purpose of the tool. When you run Sweave this way, the Sweave document inherits the sessions state. Heres why thats a bad idea.rnrnSay youre interactively tinkering with some plots to make them look like you want. As you go, youre copying R code into an Sweave file. When youre done, you run Sweave on your file, compile the resulting LaTeX document, and get beautiful output. You congratulate yourself on having gone to the effort to put all your R code in an Sweave file so that it will be self-contained and reproducible. You forget about your project then revisit it six months later. You run Sweave and to your chagrin it doesnt work. What happened? What might have happened is that your Sweave file depended on a variable that wasnt defined in the file itself but happened to be defined in your R session. When you open up R months later and run Sweave, that variable may be missing. Or worse, you happen to have a variable in your session with the right name that now has some unrelated value.rnrnI recommend always running Sweave from a batch file. On Windows you can save the following two lines to a file, say <code>sw.bat</code>, and process a file <code>foo.Rnw</code> with the command <code>sw foo</code>.rn<pre>  R.exe -e \"Sweave(%1.Rnw)\"rn  pdflatex.exe %1.tex</pre>rnThis assumes <code>R.exe</code> and <code>pdflatex.exe</code> are in your path. If they are not, you could either add them to your path or put their full paths in the batch file.rnrnRunning Sweave from a clean session does not insure that your file is self-contained. There could still be other implicit dependencies. But running from a clean session improves the chances that someone else will be able to reproduce the results.rnrnSee <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/troubleshooting_sweave/\">Troubleshooting Sweave</a> for some suggestions for how to prevent or recover from other possible problems with Sweave.rnrn<strong>Update</strong>: See the links provided by Gregor Gorjanc in the first comment below for related batch files and bash scripts.rnrn<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p>rnrn<strong>Related</strong>: <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/applied-r-programming-language-help/\">Help integrating R into your environment</a>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 394}

If every developer’s time is set by the same reference, say an NNTP server, then no problems will result. But what if one developer is in a different time zone? Say one developer is in Boston and one in Houston. The Boston developer checks in a file at 2:00 PM Eastern time, then 10 minutes later the Houston developer checks out the file, quickly makes a change, and checks the file back in at 2:20 Eastern time, 1:20 Central local time. VSS now says the latest version of the file is the one made at 2:00 Eastern time. When the Houston developer looks at VSS, the Boston developer’s changes were make 40 minutes into the future!rnrnThis has been a problem with VSS for all versions prior to VSS 2005, and is <strong>still a problem in the most recent version by default</strong>. Starting with the 2005 version, you can configure VSS 2005 to use “server local time.” This means all transactions will use the time on the server where the VSS repository is located. The time is stored internally as UTC (GMT) but displayed to each user according to his own time zone. In the example above, the server would record the Boston check-in as 7:00 PM UTC and the Houston check-in as 7:20 PM UTC. The Boston user would see the check-ins as happening at 2:00 and 2:20 Eastern time, and the Houston user would see the check-ins as happening at 1:00 and 1:20 Central time. Importantly, everyone agrees which check-in occurred first.rnrnA more subtle version of the problem can occur even if all users are in the same time zone but have not synchronized their clocks. This is a good reason to use server local time even if everyone works in the same city.rnrnAlthough it is possible to set server local time in VSS 2005, it still uses client local time by default, presumably for backward compatibility. You have to turn on server local time by opening the VSS Administrator tool and clicking on Tools/Options and going to the Time Zone tab.rnrn<img src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/VSSOptions.png\" alt=\"SourceSafe Options dialog for time zones\" width=\"408\" height=\"419\" border=\"0\" />rnrnMicrosoft has written about this problem at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931804. Note that the solution only applies to Visual SourceSafe 2005 and later.rnrnWhen you set the time zone, you will get dire warnings discouraging you from doing so.rn<blockquote>To avoid unintended data loss, do not change the time zone for a Visual SourceSafe database after it has been established and is being used.</blockquote>rnYou may have to let VSS set idle for as many hours as your developers span time zones to let everything synchronize.", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 471}

Let<em> f<sub>X</sub></em> be the probability density function (PDF) of <em>X</em> and let <em>F<sub>X</sub></em> be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of <em>X</em>. Define <em>f<sub>Y</sub></em> and <em>F<sub>Y</sub></em> similarly.

For Bayesians, we argue that our method is more consistently Bayesian than other methods in common use. For frequentists, we show that our method has better frequentist operating characteristics than the most commonly used safety monitoring method.rnrnThe paper looks at binary and time-to-event trials. The results are most dramatic for the time-to-event analog of the <a href=\"https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/SoftwareDownload/SingleSoftware.aspx?Software_Id=3\">Thall-Simon</a> method, the <a href=\"https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/SoftwareDownload/SingleSoftware.aspx?Software_Id=73\">Thall-Wooten</a> method, as shown below.rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/bs_vs_thall_wooten.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"415\" height=\"384\" /></p>rnThis graph plots the probability of concluding that an experimental treatment is inferior when simulating from true mean survival times ranging from 2 to 12 months. The trial is designed to test a null hypothesis of 6 months mean survival against an alternative hypothesis of 8 months mean survival. When the true mean survival time is less than the alternative hypothesis of 8 months, the Bayes factor design is more likely to stop early. And when the true mean survival time is greater than the alternative hypothesis, the Bayes factor method is less likely to stop early.rnrnThe Bayes factor method also outperforms the Thall-Simon method for monitoring single-arm trials with binary outcomes. The Bayes factor method stops more often when it should and less often when it should not. However, the difference in operating characteristics is not as pronounced as in the time-to-event case.rnrnThe paper also compares the Bayes factor method to the frequentist mainstay, the Simon two-stage design. Because the Bayes factor method uses continuous monitoring, the method is able to use fewer patients while maintaining the type I and type II error rates of the Simon design as illustrated in the graph below.rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/bf_vs_simon.gif\" alt=\"bayes factor vs simon two-stage designs \" width=\"436\" height=\"397\" /></p>rnThe graph above plots the number of patients used in a trial testing a null hypothesis of a 0.2 response rate against an alternative of a 0.4 response rate. Design 8 is the Bayes factor method advocated in the paper. Designs 7a and 7b are variations on the Simon two-stage design. The horizontal axis gives the true probabilities of response. We simulated true probabilities of response varying from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.05. The vertical axis gives the number of patients treated before the trial was stopped. When the true probability of response is less than the alternative hypothesis, the Bayes factor method treats fewer patients. When the true probability of response is better than the alternative hypothesis, the Bayes factor method treats slightly more patients.rnrnDesign 7a is the strict interpretation of the Simon method: one interim look at the data and another analysis at the end of the trial. Design 7b is the Simon method as implemented in practice, stopping when the criteria for continuing cannot be met at the next analysis. (For example, if the design says to stop if there are three or fewer responses out of the first 15 patients, then the method would stop after the 12th patient if there have been no responses.) In either case, the Bayes factor method uses fewer patients. The rejection probability curves, not shown here, show that the Bayes factor method matches (actually, slightly improves upon) the type I and type II error rates for the Simon two-stage design.rnrn<strong>Related</strong>: <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/clinical-trial-design/\">Adaptive clinical trial design</a>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 555}

The total cost of a solution has to account for not only the cost of solving the all the sub-problems, but also the cost of dividing the original problem into sub-problems and the cost of assembling the solutions to the sub-problems into a solution to the original problem. For example, the cost of writing a program is not simply the cost of each of the subroutines that comprise the final program. The cost has to include the cost of dividing the original task into subroutines and the cost of integrating these subroutines into the final product.rnrnThere is a theorem in computer science that quantifies the fuzzy statements above.rnrnLet <em>a</em> ≥ 1 and <em>b</em> &gt; 1 be constants.

The recurrence relation says we have a way of breaking the original problem into <em>b</em> sub-problems of size <em>n</em>/<em>b</em>, each of which takes a units of work to solve. The cost of breaking the original problem into sub-problems and assembling the solutions into the final solution is described by <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>).rnrnThe theorem, which <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2IjhPGt\">Introduction to Algorithms</a> (ISBN 0262032937) calls the \"master theorem,\" says that the total cost <em>T</em>(<em>n</em>) of the solution can be bound according to three separate cases.rn<ol>rn \t<li>If <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = <em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup>log<em><sub>b</sub>a</em> − ε</sup>) for some constant ε &gt; 0 then <em>T</em>(<em>n</em>) = <em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup>log<em><sub>b</sub>a</em></sup>).</li>rn \t<li>If <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = <em>T</em>(<em>n</em><sup>log<em><sub>b</sub>a</em></sup>), then <em>T</em>(<em>n</em>) = <em>T</em>(<em>n</em><sup>log<em><sub>b</sub>a</em></sup> lg(<em>n</em>)).</li>rn \t<li>If <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = (<em>n</em><sup>log<em><sub>b</sub>a</em> + ε</sup>) for some constant ε &gt; 0, and if <em>a</em> <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>/<em>b</em>) = <em>c</em> <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) for some constant <em>c</em> &lt; 1 and for all sufficiently large <em>n</em>, then <em>T</em>(<em>n</em>) = <em>O</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>n</em>)).</li>rn</ol>rnThe notation <em>O</em>, Ω, and Θ is explained in these notes on <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/asymptotic_notation/\">asymptotic order notation</a>.rnrnThe main point here is that the term <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>), the one we tend to think less about, is the most important term in the theorem. <em>T</em>(<em>n</em>), the total time for the solution, breaks into three cases depending on whether grows at a rate slower, equal to, or faster than a multiple of <em>n</em><sup>log<em><sub>b</sub>a</em></sup>.rnrnStrictly speaking, the theorem applies to the cost (operation count) of <em>running </em>a program.

One objection is that someone has already written the play, either Shakespeare or someone else. If Shakespeare wrote it, then the probability is one that he did. Otherwise the probability is zero. By this reasoning, no one can make probability statements about anything that has already happened. Another objection is that probability only applies to random processes. We cannot apply probability to questions about document authorship because documents are not random.rnrnI just ran across a <a href=\"http://tdunning.blogspot.com/2008/04/words-at-random-carefully-chosen.html\">blog post</a> by Ted Dunning that weighs in on this question. He writesrn<blockquote>The statement \"It cannot be probability &hellip;\" is essentially a tautology. It should read, \"We cannot use the word probability to describe our state of knowledge because we have implicitly accepted the assumption that probability cannot be used to describe our state of knowledge\".</blockquote>rnHe goes on to explain that if we think about statements of knowledge in terms of probabilities, we get a consistent system, so we might as well reason as if its OK to use probability theory.rnrnThe uncertainty about the authorship of the play does not exist in history — an omniscient historian would know who wrote it. Nor does it exist in nature — the play was not created by a random process. The uncertainty is in our heads. We dont know who wrote it. But if we use numbers to represent our uncertainty, and we agree to certain common-sense axioms about how this should be done, <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/03/19/plausible-reasoning/\">we inevitably get probability theory</a>.rnrnAs <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/03/03/probability-and-information/\">E.

But instead of just selecting the most important variables in a purely statistical sense, he factored in the cost of collecting each variable. So if two variables make nearly equal contributions to a model, for example, the procedure would give preference to the variable that is cheaper to collect. In short, Draper recommended a cost-benefit analysis rather than the typical (statistical) benefit-only analysis. Very reasonable.rnrnWhy dont people always take this approach? One reason is that its hard to assign utilities to outcomes. Dollar costs are often easy to account for, but it can be much harder to assign values to benefits. For example, you have to ask \"Benefit for whom?\" In a medical context, do you want to maximize the benefit to patients? Doctors? Insurance companies? Tax payers? Regulators? Statisticians? If you want to maximize some combination of these factors, how do you weight the interests of the various parties?rnrnAssigning utilities is hard work, and you can never make everyone happy. No matter how good of a job you do, someone will criticize you. Nearly everyone agrees in the abstract that considering utilities is the way to go, but in practice it is hardly ever done. Anyone who proposes a way to quantify utility is immediately shot down by people who have a better idea. The net result is that rather than using a reasonable but  imperfect idea of utility, no utility is used at all. Or rather no <em>explicit</em> definition of utility is used. There is usually some implicit idea of utility, chosen for mathematical convenience, and that one wins by default. In general, people much prefer to leave utilities implicit.rnrnIn the Q&amp;A after his talk, Draper said something to the effect that the status quo persists for a very good reason:<strong> thinking is hard work, and it opens you up to criticism</strong>.rnrn", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 432}

The forward difference of the sequence of squares 1, 4, 9, 16, ... is the sequence of odd numbers 3, 5, 7, ...rnrnThere are many identities for the forward difference operator that resemble analogous formulas for derivatives. For example, the forward difference operator has its own product rule, quotient rule, etc. These rules are called the calculus of finite differences. The finite results are often much easier to prove than their continuous counterparts.rnrnThe calculus of finite differences makes it possible to solve some discrete problems systematically, analogous to the way one would solve continuous problems with more familiar differential calculus. For example, there is a \"summation by parts\" technique for computing sums analogous to<a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/02/28/what-to-make-u-in-integration-by-parts/\"> integration by parts</a> for integrals.rnrnThe product rule for forward differences looks a little odd:rnrn<img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"background-color: white;\" src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/cofd2.svg\" alt=\"Delta(f(x)g(x)) = g(x) Delta f(x) + f(x+1) Delta g(x)\" />rnrnThe left hand side is symmetric in <em>f</em> and <em>g</em> though the right side is not. There is also a symmetric version:rnrn<img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"background-color: white;\" src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/cofd3.svg\" alt=\"Delta(f(x)g(x)) = g(x) Delta f(x) + f(x) Delta g(x) + Delta f(x) Delta g(x)\" />rnrnHere is the quotient rule for forward differences.rnrn<img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"background-color: white;\" src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/cofd4.svg\" alt=\"Delta frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = frac{g(x) Delta f(x) - f(x) Delta g(x)}{g(x)g(x+1)}\" />rnrnOne of the first things you learn in calculus is how to take the derivative of powers of <em>x</em>: the derivative of <em>x<sup>n</sup></em> is <em>n</em> <em>x</em><sup><em>n</em>−1</sup>. There is an analogous formula in the calculus of finite differences, but with a different kind of power of <em>x</em>. For positive integers <em>n</em>, define the <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> falling power of <em>x</em> byrnrn<img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"background-color: white;\" src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/cofd5.svg\" alt=\"x^{(n)} equiv x(x-1)(x-2)cdots(x-n+1)\" />rnrnThenrnrn<img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"background-color: white;\" src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/cofd6.svg\" alt=\"Delta x^{(n)} = nx^{(n-1)}\" />rnrnFalling powers can be generalized to non-integer exponents by definingrnrn<img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"background-color: white;\" src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/cofd7.svg\" alt=\"x^{(n)} equiv frac{Gamma(x+1)}{Gamma(x-n+1)}\" />rnrnThe formula for finite difference of falling powers given above remains valid when using the more general definition of falling powers.

Similarly, define M<sub>&minus;∞</sub>( <strong><em>x</em></strong> ) to be the limit of M<em><sub>r</sub></em>( <strong><em>x</em></strong> ) as <em>r</em> goes to –∞. Then M<sub>∞</sub>( <strong><em>x</em></strong> ) equals max(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>3</sub>…, <em>x</em><sub>n</sub>) and M<sub>&minus;∞</sub>( <strong><em>x</em></strong> ) equals min(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>3</sub>…, <em>x</em><sub>n</sub>).rnrnIn summary, the <strong>minimum</strong>, <strong>harmonic mean</strong>, <strong>geometric mean</strong>, <strong>arithmetic mean</strong> and <strong>maximum </strong>are all special cases of M<em><sub>r</sub></em>( <strong><em>x</em></strong> ) corresponding to <em>r</em> = –∞, –1, 0, 1, and ∞ respectively. Of course other values of r are possible; these five are just the most familiar. Another common example is the root-mean-square (RMS) corresponding to <em>r</em> = 2.rnrnA famous theorem says that the geometric mean is never greater than the arithmetic mean. This is a very special case of the following theorem.rn<blockquote>If <em>r</em> ≤<em> s</em> then M<em><sub>r</sub></em>( <strong><em>x</em></strong> ) ≤ M<sub><em>s</em></sub>( <strong><em>x</em></strong> ).</blockquote>rnIn fact we can say a little more. If <em>r</em> &lt;<em> s</em> then M<em><sub>r</sub></em>( <strong><em>x</em></strong> ) &lt; M<sub><em>s</em></sub>( <strong><em>x</em></strong> ) unless <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> <em>= x</em><sub>2</sub> = <em>x</em><sub>3 </sub>= …. = <em>x</em><sub>n </sub>or <em>s</em> ≤ 0 and one of the <em>x</em><sub>i</sub> is zero.rnrnWe could generalize the means M<em><sub>r</sub></em> a bit more by introducing positive weights <em>p</em><sub>i</sub> such that <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> +<em> p</em><sub>2</sub> + <em>p</em><sub>3</sub> + … + <em>p</em><sub>n</sub> = 1. We could then define M<em><sub>r</sub></em>( <strong><em>x</em></strong> ) asrn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/mean2.svg\" alt=\"M_r(x) = left( sum_{i = 1}^n p_i x_i^r right)^{1/r}\" style=\"background-color:white\" /></p>rnwith the same fine print as in the previous definition. The earlier definition reduces to this new definition with <em>p</em><sub>i</sub> = 1/<em>n</em>. The above statements about the means M<em><sub>r</sub></em>( <strong><em>x</em></strong> ) continue to hold under this more general definition.rnrnFor more on means and inequalities, see <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2U0Paxm\">Inequalities</a> by Hardy, Littlewood, and Pólya.rnrn<strong>Update</strong>: Analogous results for <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2009/03/26/means-and-inequalities-for-functions/\">means of functions</a>, replacing sums with integrals.

He wrote an interesting reply that I am including below with his permission.rn<blockquote>Mr. Cook,rnrnWell, let’s see, how did I come to revisit the world of Spherical Trigonometry?rnrnIn the early 1970’s I lived within a mile of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in southern Alabama. I took up daytime sailing with some of my friends from work (they sailed — I just went along for the ride).rnrnEventually I brought up the concern of being out of sight of land and how do we know where we are. In addition to LORAN navigation receiver and a Radio Direction Finder receiver they always had at least two navigation sextants on board. They demonstrated very quickly and without much detail how to get a “fix.”rnrnI never thought much about it after that until I was at a yard sale in our town and there was a small book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LRLMSq\">Celestial Navigation for Yachtsmen</a> by Mary Blewitt. I spent the dollar, took it home and spent the next year or so reading it over and over until I had a idea of what was really going on with simple calculations and the examples using tables and charts.rnrnHaving taken most of the mathematics courses available in three different colleges I knew there had to be strong basis for Spherical Trigonometry in Celestial Navigation.rnrnAnyway, her book deals exclusively with finding out where you are but not how to point yourself with the true heading for where you want to go. So I dug out several of my old textbooks including the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SYhnT8\">Schaum’s Outline</a> Series by Frank Ayres, Jr., and found just what I was looking for.rnrnNow, let me digress for a moment. In the art of Celestial Navigation you really need three important items: the sextant, a reasonably accurate watch and either a Nautical Almanac or an Air Navigation Almanac. Nowadays you can buy a digital watch for less than $30.00 that keeps time better than anything they had during World War II. With those 3 items and some simple Spherical Trigonometry you can easily determine your location on the earth (<a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/spherical_trigonometry.html#lawofsines\">Law of Sines</a> and <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/spherical_trigonometry.html#lawofcosines\">Law of Cosines</a>).rnrnSo, time for a case scenario.rnrnYou’re out to sea. A storm comes up. The vessel loses all electronic instrumentation (radios, compasses, computers, LORAN, GPS, etc.).  (If you think this doesn’t happen in real life, think again!) But, as long as you can see the sun during the day you’re in better shape than you think.rnrnMost important — you must have at least one watch that is set for Greenwich Mean Time!rnrnAs it is getting about mid-day you start taking sextant sights of the Sun. when it reaches its peak you write down your watch time. With 15 degrees per hour from midnight on your watch you now have local time. With the almanac you can get the declination of the Sun. You should have a reasonable idea of where you think you are. Combine that with two or three Spherical Trigonometry calculations and you can get your “fix.”rnrnKnowing where you are and where you should be headed and using Napier’s Analogies, you can determine where you should point your vessel and get on you way. With a few more calculations you can actually determine how many hours of daylight you have left — and — when the sun will come up in the morning to give you a good reference check.rnrnSo curiosity got the best of me. I started playing with Spherical Trigonometry, logarithm tables, and a very good slide rule all over again. The name of the game is not to just use the formulas and the equations but derive them so that you don’t have to try to memorize them and make a mental translation error.rnrnI think one of the things we are doing today is forgetting how we got where we are using certain fields of mathematics and relying too heavily on technology that can easily fail us. Spherical Trigonometry is just an extension of 1 plus 1 equals 2. It just takes some reading and practice, practice, practice.rnrnBy the way, another book (if you can find it) that is really helpful is, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37xU60M\">Standard Mathematical Tables</a>.rnrnKeep in touch. Let me know how people respond to my background and also the sources of information.rnrnMel Hagenrnrnmbhagen@yahoo.com</blockquote>rn<h2>Related links</h2>rn<ul>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/spherical_trigonometry/\">Spherical trigonometry</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2009/03/02/what-is-the-shape-of-the-earth/\">What is the shape of the Earth?</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/09/11/finding-distances-using-latitude-and-longitude/\">Finding distances using latitude and longitude</a></li>rn</ul>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 818}

Mathematical packages make it easy to produce a basic plot with default options. But Ive found it difficult to change the aesthetics of a plot in every mathematical package Ive used.

According to the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36um1xa\">Oxford English Dictionary</a>, the word derives from the Latin for \"to make clear, prove\"; thus it came to mean, by one thread of derivation, \"the evidence offered as proof\", which is to say, \"the information offered\", which led to its meaning in Lisp.

Because data formats change and physical media decay, youve got to keep copying your data to save it. He coined the term <a href=\"http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/12/movage.php\">movage</a> to describe the active process of preserving data.rn<blockquote><strong>The only way to archive digital information is to keep it moving</strong>. I call this <strong>movage</strong> instead of storage. Proper movage means transferring the material to current platforms on a regular basis … anything you want moved to the future has to be given attention to keep it moving forward.</blockquote>rnThis morning I had problems running LaTeX (with <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/07/24/latex-and-powerpoint-presentations/\"> Beamer</a>) on an old presentation and thought about my friends advice.rnrn<h2>Related links</h2>rn<ul>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2010/03/31/maintenance-costs/\">Maintenance costs</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2011/10/21/software-maintenance/\">Why does software need to be maintained?</a></li>rn</ul>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 279}

In early computers, a buffer cushioned the interaction between files and the computer’s central processing unit. The drums or tapes that held a file and the central processing unit were pieces of equipment that were very different from each other, working at their own speeds, in spurts. The buffer made it possible for them to work together effectively. Eventually, the buffer grew from being an intermediary, a temporary holding place, to being the place where work is done. This transformation is rather like that of a small seaport that grew into a great city: once it was merely the place where cargo was warehoused temporarily before being loaded onto ships; then it became a business and cultural center in its own right.</blockquote>rnFrom <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/html_mono/emacs-lisp-intro.html#fn-2\">An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp</a>.

If someone had already discovered one way of thinking about types that was always best, we imagine that everyone would know about it by now.</blockquote>rnSource: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37BlI59\">Real World Haskell</a>.rnrnThe second sentence applies equally well to all Ford-Chevy arguments: if one alternative were uniformly better than all others, word would get out. These arguments rage because they involve comparisons along multiple (often implicit) criteria and no alternative is simultaneously better by all criteria.rnrnThe relative advantages of programming languages depend on how the languages are used. Although dynamic languages place less emphasis on safety, programs written in dynamic languages may be <a href=\"../2010/06/09/dynamic-typing-and-risk-homeostasis/\">safer in practice</a> than this would imply. Also, in general it is easier to <a href=\"../2009/08/11/reasoning-about-code/\">reason about code</a> written in a statically typed language. However, a programmer can easily subvert strong static typing by writing stringly typed code. Code written in well in a dynamically typed  language will be easier to read than code written poorly in a statically typed language.rnrnComparisons of the advantages static and dynamic typing are nearly impossible. You could try to argue about what would happen \"all other things being equal,\" but of course all other things are never equal.rnrn<strong>Related post</strong>: <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2009/06/16/hawthorne-effect/\">Questioning the Hawthorne effect</a>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 236}

And most of these use the canonical example of <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/rarediseases.pdf\">testing for rare diseases</a>. But the connection between these examples and Bayesian statistics is not obvious at first. Maybe this isnt the best approach.rnrnWhat if we <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RwXnb0\">begin with the end in mind</a>? Bayesian calculations produce posterior probability distributions on parameters. An effective way to teach Bayesian statistics might be to start there. Suppose we had probability distributions on our parameters. Never mind where they came from. Never mind classical objections that say you cant do this. What if you could? If you had such distributions, what could you do with them?rnrnFor starters, point estimation and interval estimation become trivial. You could, for example, use the distribution mean as a point estimate and the area between two quantiles as an interval estimate. The distributions tell you far more than  point estimates or interval estimates could; these estimates are simply summaries of the information contained in the distributions.rnrnIt makes logical sense to start with Bayes Theorem since thats the tool used to construct posterior distributions. But I think it makes <em>pedagogical</em> sense to start with the posterior distribution and work backward to how one would come up with such a thing.rnrnBayesian statistics is so named because Bayes Theorem is essential to its calculations. But thats a little like classical statistics Central Limitist statistics because it relies heavily on the Central Limit Theorem.rnrnThe key idea of Bayesian statistics is to represent all uncertainty by probability distributions. That idea can be obscured by an early emphasis on calculations.rn<h2>More posts on Bayesian statistics</h2>rn<ul>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2011/02/02/david-spiegelhalter/\">Interview with David Spiegelhalter</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2011/01/12/occams-razor-bayes-theorem/\">Occams razor and Bayes theorem</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2009/04/28/reasons-to-use-bayesian-inference/\">Four reasons to use Bayesian inference</a></li>rn</ul>rn", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 294}

The anti-calculus proposition says that for analytic functions, the derivative <em>cannot</em> be zero at the maximum.rnrnTo be more precise, a differentiable real-valued function on a closed interval takes on its maximum where the derivative is zero or at one of the ends. Its possible that the maximum occurs at one of the ends of the interval <em>and</em> the derivative is zero there.rnrnThe anti-calculus proposition says that the analogous situation cannot occur for functions of a complex variable. Suppose a function <em>f</em> is analytic on a closed disk and suppose that <em>f</em> is not constant. Then |<em>f</em>| must take on its maximum somewhere on the boundary by the maximum modulus theorem.

Mt. Everest comes to mind, but its summit is the point highest above sea level, not the point farthest from the center. These are not the same because the Earth is not perfectly spherical.rnrnOur planet bulges slightly at the equator due to its rotation. The equatorial diameter is about 0.3% larger than the polar diameter. Sea level at the equator is about 20 kilometers farther from the center of the Earth than sea level at the poles.rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/Chimborazo.jpg\" alt=\"Chimborazo in Ecuador\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" /></p>rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EL_CHIMBORAZO.jpg\">Photo via Wikipedia</a></p>rnMt. Everest is about nine kilometers above sea level and located about 28 degrees north of the equator. Chimborazo, the highest point in Ecuador, is seven kilometers above sea level and 1.5 degrees south of the equator.rnrnSo how far are Mt. Everest and Chimborazo from the center of the Earth? To answer that, we first need to how far sea level at latitude θ is from the center of the Earth.rnrnImagine slicing the Earth with a plane containing its polar diameter. To a good approximation (within 100 meters) the resulting shape would be an ellipse. The equation of this ellipse isrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">(<em>x</em> / <em>a</em>)<sup>2</sup> + (<em>y</em> / <em>b</em>)<sup>2</sup> = 1</p>rnwhere <em>a</em> = 6378.1 km is the equatorial radius and <em>b</em> = 6356.8 km is the polar radius. A line from the center of the ellipse to a point at latitude θ has equation <em>y</em> = tan(θ) <em>x</em>. Solving the pair of equations for <em>x</em> shows that the distance from the center to the point at latitude θ isrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>d</em> = sqrt( <em>a</em><sup>2</sup><em>b</em><sup>2</sup> sec<sup>2 </sup>θ / (<em>a</em><sup>2</sup> tan<sup>2</sup> θ + <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> ) )</p>rnFor Mt. Everest, θ = 27.99 degrees and so <em>d</em> = 6373.4. For Chimborazo, θ = −1.486 degrees and so <em>d</em> = 6378.1. So sea level is 4.7 km higher at Chimborazo. Mt. Everest is 2.6 km taller, but the summit of Chimborazo is about 2.1 km farther away from the center of the Earth.rnrn<strong>Update</strong>: See my <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2011/09/17/latitude-doesnt-exactly-mean-what-i-thought/\">next post</a> for a slight correction. A more accurate calculation would compute sea level is about 4.65 km higher at Chimborazo than Mt.

Volunteer fire fighters are amateurs in the best sense, doing what they do out of love of the work and love for the community they serve.rnrnUnfortunately <em>professional</em> implies someone is good at what they do, and <em>amateur</em> implies they are not. Maybe skill and compensation were more strongly correlated in the past. When most people had less leisure a century or two ago, few had the time to become highly proficient at something they were not paid for. Now the distinction is more fuzzy.rnrnBecause more people work for large organizations, public and private, it is easier to hide incompetence; market forces act more directly on the self-employed. Its not uncommon to find people in large organizations who are professional only in the pecuniary sense.rnrnIts also more common now to find people who are quite good at something they choose not to practice for a living.

This estimate was based on too small a run. A more reliable estimate based on a longer run was 300 CPU hours, about two weeks running on a single processor. Before I split the problem up to run in parallel, I wanted to see if I could make each thread run faster.rnrnThe most expensive part of the simulation is a function that takes in four integer parameters and does a numerical integration. Each parameter could be any value from 0 to 120. So in principle there are 121<sup>4</sup> = 214,358,881 possible parameter combinations. I knew that some of these combinations were extremely unlikely or impossible, so I thought I could reduce the execution time by caching the most commonly called parameters. Maybe a few thousand arguments would account for most of the function calls.rnrnI saved the function arguments and computed values in map, a.k.a. dictionary, associative array, etc. (The buzz word for this is <em>memoization</em>.) I set a maximum size on the map because I thought it could grow very large. Even if, say, a thousand arguments accounted for most of the function calls, maybe there were many more that only appeared once.rnrnIt turned out that the function was only called with 408 distinct parameter combinations. That means the same integrals were being evaluated millions of times. Caching these values reduced the execution time by a factor of about 800. In other words, the software could retrieve a previously computed value 800x faster than compute it from scratch.rnrnThe simulation that would have taken 300 hours took only 22 minutes, and so there was no need to make it run in parallel.rnrn<strong>Update</strong>: I found a bug in my hashing algorithm. After fixing the bug, the time to run my simulations increased to 38 minutes. So my speed-up was a about a factor of 420 rather than 800, but still enough to run on one thread over lunch. The number of distinct arguments to the numerical integration was much more than 408 in the corrected program, but still small enough to cache.rn", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 355}

The first three volumes are devoted torn<ol>rn\t<li>Fourier series and integrals</li>rn\t<li>Complex analysis</li>rn\t<li>Measure theory, Lebesgue integration, and Hilbert spaces.</li>rn</ol>rnThe first three books are not necessarily prerequisites for the fourth book, though the final book does assume familiarity with the basics of the topics in the earlier books. The final book does make fairly frequent references to its predecessors. Someone who has not read the first three volumes — I have not — can let these references go by.rnrnStein and Shakarchi bring in several topics that may not be considered functional analysis <em>per se</em> but are often included in functional analysis books, namely harmonic analysis and generalized functions. It goes into territory less often included in a functional analysis text: probability, Brownian motion, and an introduction to several complex variables. This broad selection of topics is in keeping with the stated aims of the lecture seriesrn<blockquote>to present, in an integrated manner, the core areas of analysis … to make plain the organic unity that exists between the various parts of the subject …</blockquote>rnThe goal of integrating various parts of analysis may be most clearly seen in the fourth chapter: Applications of the Baire Category Theorem. The material here is not organized by result but rather by proof technique.rnrnEach chapter ends with a set of \"exercises\" and a set of \"problems.\" The former are closely related to the material in the book and include generous hints. The latter are more challenging and go beyond the scope of the book.rnrn<strong>Related</strong>: <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/applied-functional-analysis/\">Applied functional analysis</a>rnrn", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 312}

The coefficient of <em>x<sup>k</sup></em> in the polynomial <em>R</em><sub><em>m</em>,<em>n</em></sub>(<em>x</em>) is the number of ways you can arrange <em>k</em> rooks on an <em>m</em> by <em>n</em> chessboard such that no two rooks are in the same row or column.rnrnThe rook polynomials are related to the Laguerre polynomials byrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>R</em><sub><em>m</em>,<em>n</em></sub>(<em>x</em>) = <em>n</em>! <em>x<sup>n</sup></em> <em>L</em><sub><em>n</em></sub><sup><em>m</em>−<em>n</em></sup>(−1/<em>x</em>)</p>rnwhere <em>L<sub>n</sub><sup>k</sup></em>(<em>x</em>) is an \"associated Laguerre polynomial.\" These polynomials satisfy Laguerres differential equationrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>x</em> <em>y</em> + (<em>n </em>+ 1 − <em>x</em>) <em>y</em> + <em>k</em> <em>y</em> = 0,</p>rnan equation that comes up in numerous contexts in physics.

Suppose you start with two non-negative numbers and take their arithmetic mean and geometric mean. Then take the arithmetic and geometric mean of the results.

If you are in an emergency room with a broken leg and the person next to you is lapsing into a diabetic coma, the two of you will be treated differently.rnrnThe aim of personalized medicine is to increase the <em>degree</em> of personalization, not to introduce personalization. In particular, there is the popular notion that it will become routine to sequence your DNA any time you receive medical attention, and that this sequence data will enable treatment uniquely customized for you. All we have to do is collect a lot of data and let computers sift through it. There are numerous reasons why this is incredibly naive. Here are three to start with.rn<ul>rn \t<li>Maybe the information relevant to treating your malady is in how DNA is expressed, not in the DNA per se, in which case a sequence of your genome would be useless. Or maybe the most important information is not genetic at all. <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2009/02/18/the-data-may-not-contain-the-answer/\">The data may not contain the answer.rn</a></li>rn \t<li>Maybe the information a doctor needs is not in one gene but in the interaction of 50 genes or 100 genes. Unless a small number of genes are involved, there is no way to explore the combinations by brute force. For example, the number of ways to select 5 genes out of 20,000 is 26,653,335,666,500,004,000. The number of ways to select 32 genes is over a googol, and <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2010/10/13/googol/\">there isnt a googol of anything in the universe</a>. Moores law will not get us around this impasse.</li>rn \t<li>Most clinical trials use no biomarker information at all. It is exceptional to incorporate information from one biomarker. Investigating a handful of biomarkers in a single trial is statistically dubious. Blindly exploring tens of thousands of biomarkers is out of the question, at least with current approaches.</li>rn</ul>rnGenetic technology has the potential to incrementally increase the degree of personalization in medicine.

Outcome-adaptive <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/randomization/\">randomization</a> \"bends\" the coin to favor what appears to be the better treatment at the time each randomized assignment is made. The method aims to treat more patients in the trial effectively, and <strong>on average</strong> it succeeds.rnrnHowever, looking only at the average number of patients assigned to each treatment arm conceals the fact that the number of patients assigned to each arm can be surprisingly variable compared to equal randomization.rnrnSuppose we have 100 patients to enroll in a clinical trial. If we assign each patient to a treatment arm with probability 1/2, there will be about 50 patients on each treatment. The following histogram shows the number of patients assigned to the first treatment arm in 1000 simulations. The standard deviation is about 5.rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/er2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"271\" /></p>rnNext we let the randomization probability vary. Suppose the true probability of response is 50% on one arm and 70% on the other. We model the probability of response on each arm as a beta distribution, starting from a uniform prior. We randomize to an arm with probability equal to the posterior probability that that arm has higher response. The histogram below shows the number of patients assigned to the better treatment in 1000 simulations.rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/ar_noburn.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"271\" /></p>rnThe standard deviation in the number of patients is now about 17. Note that while most trials assign 50 or more patients to the better treatment, some trials in this simulation put less than 20 patients on this treatment. Not only will these trials treat patients less effectively, they will also have low statistical power (as will the trials that put nearly all the patients on the better arm).rnrnThe reason for this volatility is that the method can easily be mislead by early outcomes. With one or two early failures on an arm, the method could assign more patients to the other arm and not give the first arm a chance to redeem itself.rnrnBecause of this dynamic, various methods have been proposed to add \"ballast\" to adaptive randomization. See a comparison of three such methods <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/tuning_adaptive_randomization.pdf\">here</a>. These methods reduce the volatility in adaptive randomization, but do not eliminate it. For example, the following histogram shows the effect of adding a burn-in period to the example above, randomizing the first 20 patients equally.rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/ar_burn.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"271\" /></p>rnThe standard deviation is now 13.8, less than without the burn-in period, but still large compared to a standard deviation of 5 for equal randomization.rnrnAnother approach is to transform the randomization probability. If we use an <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/exponential_tuning_parameter.pdf\">exponential tuning parameter</a> of 0.5, the sample standard deviation of the number of patients on the better arm is essentially the same, 13.4. If we combine a burn-in period of 20 and an exponential parameter of 0.5, the sample standard deviation is 11.7, still more than twice that of equal randomization.rn<h2>Related</h2>rn<ul>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/power_bias.pdf\">Power and bias in adaptively randomized clinical trials</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/07/22/three-ways-of-tuning-an-adaptively-randomized-trial/\">Three ways of tuning an adaptively randomized trial</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2024/05/28/alpha-spending/\">Interim looks and alpha spending</a></li>rn</ul>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 520}

Im looking for ways to speed this up.rnrnHeres my latest idea: <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/edgeworth.pdf\">Approximating random inequalities with Edgeworth expansions</a>rnrnAn Edgeworth expansion is like a Fourier series, except you use derivatives of the normal density as your basis rather than sine functions. Sometimes the full Edgeworth expansion does not converge and yet the first few terms make a good approximation. The tech report explicitly considers Edgeworth approximations with just two terms, but demonstrates the integration tricks necessary to use more terms. The result is computed in closed form, no numerical integration required, and so may be much faster than other approaches.rnrnOne advantage of the Edgeworth approach is that it only depends on the moments of the distributions in the inequality. This means it provides an approximation thats waiting to be used on new families of distributions. But because its not specific to a distribution family, its performance in a particular case needs to be explored. In the case of <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2012/10/15/beta-inequalities/\">beta distributions</a>, for example, even a single-term approximation does pretty well.rnrn<h2>More blog posts on random inequalities</h2>rn<ul>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/07/26/random-inequalities-i/\">Introduction</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/07/26/random-inequalities-ii-analytical-results/\">Analytical results</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/07/26/random-inequalities-iii-numerical-results/\">Numerical results</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/08/09/random-inequalities-iv-cauchy-distributions/\">Cauchy distributions</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/08/21/random-inequalities-v-beta-distributions/\">Beta distributions</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/08/30/random-inequalities-vi-gamma-distributions/\">Gamma distributions</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/09/06/random-inequalities-vii-three-or-more-variables/\">Three or more random variables</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2009/07/13/random-inequalities-folded-normal/\">Folded normals</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2011/09/27/bayesian-amazon/\">A Bayesian view of Amazon Resellers</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2012/10/15/beta-inequalities/\">Fast approximation of beta inequalities</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2012/10/17/shifting-probability-distributions/\">Shifting probability distributions</a></li>rn</ul>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 252}

If you get rid of all your stuff, youre deciding to hire other people to meet your needs. You can get rid of your house if youre willing to rent your shelter from hotels. You can get rid of your pots and pans if youre willing to pay restaurants to prepare your food with their pots and pans.

Extreme change can be more impressive, so people who sell everything get invited to talk at TED, whereas people who cut their living expenses by 20% and slowly pay off their debts get 30 seconds on the Dave Ramsey Show. People who sacrifice to achieve their goals slowly while maintaining their responsibilities are less impressive at first glance, but more impressive after more thought.rnrnExtreme change can also be temporary. Lottery winners go bankrupt. People on starvation diets end up heavier than ever. One extreme change can lead to another extreme change in the opposite direction.rnrnHowever, you can also use the ease of extreme change to your advantage.

Now well look at the more realistic and more interesting case of damping γ &gt; 0. We wont consider forcing yet, so F = 0 and our equation reduces torn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>m</em> <em>u</em>&Prime; + γ <em>u</em>&prime; + <em>k u</em> = 0.</p>rnThe effect of damping obviously depends on the amount of damping, i.e. the size of γ relative to other terms. Damping removes energy from the system and so the amplitude of the oscillations goes to zero over time, regardless of the amount of damping. However, the system can have three qualitatively different behaviors: under-damping, critical damping, and over-damping.rnrnThe characteristic polynomial of the equation isrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>m</em> <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + γ <em>x</em> + <em>k</em></p>rnThis polynomial has either two complex roots, one repeated real root, or two real roots depending on whether the discriminant γ<sup>2</sup> - 4<em>mk</em> is negative, zero, or positive. These three states correspond to under-damping, critical damping, and over-damping.rn<h2>Under-damping</h2>rnWhen damping is small, the system vibrates at first approximately as if there were no damping, but the amplitude of the solutions decreases exponentially. As long as γ<sup>2</sup> &lt; 4<em>mk</em> the system is under-damped and the solution isrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>u</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>R</em> exp( –γ<em>t</em>/2<em>m</em> ) cos( μ<em>t</em>– φ )</p>rnwherern<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">μ = √(4<em>mk</em> − γ<sup>2</sup>) / 2<em>m.</em></p>rnThe amplitude R and the phase φ are determined by the initial conditions.rnrnAs an example, let γ = 1, <em>m</em> = 1, and <em>k</em> = 5. This implies μ =  √19/2. Set the initial conditions so that <em>R</em> = 6 and φ = 1. The solid blue line below is the solution 6 exp(-<em>t</em>/2) cos(<em>t</em>– 1), and the dotted green lines above and below are the exponential envelope 6 exp(-<em>t</em>/2).rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/under_damped.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"272\" /></p>rnAnd here is a <a href=\"http://youtu.be/w8oWM0TGvZo\">video</a> of the mass-spring-dashpot system in action made using the code discussed <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2013/02/20/python-animation-for-mechanical-vibrations/\">here</a>.rnrn<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/w8oWM0TGvZo?rel=0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>rnrnNote that the solution is not simply an oscillation at the natural frequency multiplied by an exponential term. The damping changes the frequency of the periodic term, though the change is small when the damping is small.rnrnThe factor μ is called the quasi-frequency. Recall from the previous post that the natural frequency, the frequency of the solution with no damping, is denoted ω<sub>0</sub>. The quasi-frequency is related to the natural frequency byrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">μ = √(1 – γ<sup>2</sup>/4<em>mk</em>) ω<sub>0</sub> ≈ (1 – γ<sup>2</sup>/8<em>mk</em>) ω<sub>0</sub>.</p>rnThe approximation above holds for small γ since a Taylor expansion shows that √(1 − <em>x</em>) ≈ 1 − <em>x</em>/2 for small <em>x</em>.rnrnThis says that the quasi-frequency decreases the natural frequency by a factor of approximately γ<sup>2</sup>/8<em>mk</em>. So when γ is small there is little change to the natural frequency, but the amount of change grows quadratically as γ increases.rn<h2>Critical damping</h2>rnCritical damping occurs when γ<sup>2</sup> = 4<em>mk</em>. In this case the solution is given byrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>u</em>(<em>t</em>) = (<em>A</em> + <em>Bt</em>) exp( – γ<em>t</em>/2<em>m</em>).</p>rnThe position of the mass will asymptotically approach 0. Depending on the initial velocity, it will either go monotonically to zero or reach some maximum displacement before it turns around and goes to 0.rnrnFor an example, let <em>m</em> = 1 and <em>k</em> = 5 as before. For critical damping, γ must equal √20. Choose initial conditions so that <em>A</em> = 1 and <em>B</em> = 10.rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/critically_damped.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"272\" /></p>rnrn<h2>Over-damping</h2>rnWhen γ<sup>2</sup> &gt; 4<em>mk</em> the system is over-damped. When damping is that large, the system does not oscillate at all.rnrnThe solution isrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>u</em>(<em>t</em>)<em> = A</em> exp(<em>r</em><sub>1</sub> <em>t</em>) + <em>B</em> exp(<em>r</em><sub>2</sub> <em>t</em>)</p>rnwhere <em>r</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>r</em><sub>2</sub> are the two roots ofrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>m</em> <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + γ <em>x</em> + <em>k</em> = 0.</p>rnBecause γ &gt; 0, both roots are negative and solutions decay exponentially to 0.rn<h2>Coming up</h2>rnThe next two posts in the series will add a forcing term, i.e. <em>F</em> &gt; 0 in our differential equation.

Under the right conditions, a Binomial(<em>n</em>, <em>p</em>) has approximately the distribution of a normal with the same mean and variance, i.e. mean <em>np</em> and variance <em>np</em>(1-<em>p</em>). The approximation works best when <em>n</em> is large and <em>p</em> is near 1/2.rnrnThis afternoon I was reading a paper that used a normal approximation to a binomial when <em>n</em> was around 10 and <em>p</em> around 0.001.  The relative error was enormous. The paper used the approximation to find an analytical expression for something else and the error propagated.rnrn<strong>A common rule of thumb</strong> is that the normal approximation works well when <em>np</em> &gt; 5 and <em>n</em>(1-<em>p</em>) &gt; 5.  This says that the closer <em>p</em> is to 0 or 1, the larger <em>n</em> needs to be. In this case <em>p</em> was very small, but <em>n</em> was not large enough to compensate since <em>np</em> was on the order of 0.01, far less than 5.rnrn<strong>Another rule of thumb</strong> is that normal approximations in general hold well near the center of the distribution but not in the tails. In particular the <em>relative</em> error in the tails can be unbounded. This paper was looking out toward the tails, and relative error mattered.rnrnFor more details, see these notes on the <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/normal_approx_to_binomial/\">normal approximation to the binomial</a>.", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 216}

Unfortunately, most of the discussion has been over whether the word \"most\" is correct, i.e. whether the proportion of false results is more or less than 50 percent. At least there is more awareness that <em>some</em> published results are false and that it would be good to have some estimate of the proportion.rnrnHowever, a more fundamental point has been lost. At the core of Ioannidis paper is the assertion that <strong>the proportion of true hypotheses under investigation matters</strong>. In terms of Bayes theorem, the <em>posterior</em> probability of a result being correct depends on the <em>prior</em> probability of the result being correct. This prior probability is vitally important, and it varies from field to field.rnrnIn a field where it is hard to come up with good hypotheses to investigate, most researchers will be testing false hypotheses, and most of their positive results will be coincidences. In another field where people have a good idea what ought to be true before doing an experiment, most researchers will be testing true hypotheses and most positive results will be correct.rnrnFor example, its very difficult to come up with a better cancer treatment. Drugs that kill cancer in a petri dish or in animal models usually dont work in humans. One reason is that these drugs may cause too much collateral damage to healthy tissue. Another reason is that treating human tumors is more complex than treating artificially induced tumors in lab animals. Of all cancer treatments that appear to be an improvement in early trials, very few end up receiving regulatory approval and changing clinical practice.rnrnA greater proportion of physics hypotheses are correct because physics has powerful theories to guide the selection of experiments. Experimental physics often succeeds because it has good support from theoretical physics. Cancer research is more empirical because there is little reliable predictive theory.

Kirk, Spock, and McCoy only have hours to live because they traveled back in time via the Atavachron without being properly prepared. (Kirk is in a period analogous to Renaissance England while Spock and McCoy are in an ice age.)rnrnIf such time travel were possible, I expect you would indeed need to be prepared. Life in Renaissance England or the last ice age would be miserable for someone with contemporary expectations, habits, fitness, etc., though things werent as bad for the people at the time.

As the name implies, this is a distribution whose density function graph is a triangle. The triangle is determined by its base, running between points <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, and a point <em>c</em> somewhere in between where the altitude intersects the base. (<em>c</em> is called the <em>foot</em> of the altitude.) The height of the triangle is whatever it needs to be for the area to equal 1 since we want the triangle to be a probability density.rnrnOne way to fit a triangular distribution to data would be to set <em>a</em> to the minimum value and <em>b</em> to the maximum value. You could pick <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are the smallest and largest <em>possible</em> values, if these values are known. Otherwise you could use the smallest and largest values in the data, or make the interval a little larger if you want the density to be positive at the extreme data values.rnrnHow do you pick <em>c</em>? One approach would be to pick it so the resulting distribution has the same mean as the data. The triangular distribution has meanrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">(<em>a</em> + <em>b</em> + <em>c</em>)/3</p>rnso you could simply solve for <em>c</em> to match the sample mean.rnrnAnother approach would be to pick <em>c</em> so that the resulting distribution has the same <em>median</em> as the data. This approach is more interesting because it cannot always be done.rnrnSuppose your sample median is <em>m</em>. You can always find a point <em>c</em> so that half the area of the triangle lies to the left of a vertical line drawn through <em>m</em>. However, this might require the foot <em>c</em> to be to the left or the right of the base [<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>]. In that case the resulting triangle is obtuse and so sides of the triangle do not form the graph of a function.rnrnFor the triangle to give us the graph of a density function, <em>c</em> must be in the interval [<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>]. Such a density has a median in the rangern<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">[<em>b</em> − (<em>b</em> − <em>a</em>)/√2, <em>a</em> + (<em>b</em> − <em>a</em>)/√2].</p>rnIf the sample median <em>m</em> is in this range, then we can solve for <em>c</em> so that the distribution has median <em>m</em>.

How many more transformations can we create by combining them? To answer this, we represent each of the transformations with a matrix.

(Im jumping ahead a little by presuming these matrices generate a group. Conceivably the dont have inverses, but in fact they do. The inverses of <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>C</em> are <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>AC</em> respectively.)</p>rn<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A little experimentation reveals that there are eight transformations: <em>I, A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>D</em> = <em>AB</em>, <em>E</em> = <em>AC</em>, <em>F</em> = <em>BC</em>, and <em>G</em> = <em>CB</em>. So in addition to the identity <em>I</em>, the do-nothing transformation, we have found four more: <em>D</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>, and <em>G</em>. These last four correspond to taking  (<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>) to</p>rnrn<ul>rn \t<li style=\"text-align: left;\">(<em>c</em> − <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>)</li>rn \t<li style=\"text-align: left;\">(<em>a</em>, <em>c</em> − <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>)</li>rn \t<li style=\"text-align: left;\">(<em>b</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>c</em>)</li>rn \t<li style=\"text-align: left;\">(<em>c</em> − <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> − <em>a</em>, <em>c</em>)</li>rn</ul>rnThis means that if we have software to compute the hypergeometric function with one fixed set of parameters, we can bootstrap that into computing the hypergeometric function with up to seven more sets of parameters. (Some of the seven new combinations could be repetitive if, for example, <em>a</em> = <em>b</em>.)rn<h2>Identifying the group</h2>rnWe have uncovered a group of order 8, and there are only 5 groups that size. We should be able to find a familiar group isomorphic to our group of transformations.rnrnThe five groups of order 8 are Z8 (cyclic group), Z4×Z2 (direct product), E8 (elementary Abelian group), D8 (dihedral group), and the quaternion group. The first three are Abelian, and our group is not, so our group must be isomorphic to either the quaternion group or the dihedral group. The quaternion group has only 1 element of order 2, and the dihedral group has 5 elements of order 2. Our group has five elements of order 2 (<em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>D</em>, <em>F</em>, <em>G</em>) and so it must be isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8, the rotations and reflections of a square. (Some authors call this D8, because the group has eight elements. Others call it D4, because it is the group based on a 4-sided figure.)rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/dihedral4.png\" alt=\"Dihedral group of order 8\" width=\"199\" height=\"201\" /></p>rn<b>Related</b>: <a href=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/applied-complex-analysis/\">Applied complex analysis</a>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 766}

The second part of the integral is zero because it is integrating a cosine over two periods.rnrnNow for the denominator. Over a full period, sin<sup>2</sup>(<em>t</em>) and cos<sup>2</sup>(<em>t</em>) take on the same values, just shifted. So the integral of sin<sup>2</sup>(<em>t</em>) is half the integral of sin<sup>2</sup>(<em>t</em>) + cos<sup>2</sup>(<em>t</em>) = 1.

So our correlation is simply cos φ: <strong>the correlation of two out-of-phase sine waves is the cosine of their phase difference</strong>. It may be a little surprising that it works out to be so simple, but the result makes sense. When φ = 0, or any multiple of 2π, the waves are identical and so the correlation should be 1. When φ = π, or an odd multiple of π, the two waves are perfectly out of phase, and so the correlation should be −1. In between these extremes the correlation oscillates, in fact it is a cosine.", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 416}

Here we look at what happens when we let <em>p</em> be a <em>negative</em> integer and we let <em>n</em> go to infinity. Well learn more about Bernoulli numbers and well see what is meant by apparently absurd statements such as 1 + 2 + 3 + … = <em>−</em>1/12.rnrnIf <em>p</em> &lt; <em>−</em>1, then the limit as <em>n</em> goes to infinity of <em>S</em><sub>p</sub>(<em>n</em>) is ζ(<em>−p</em>). That is, for <em>s</em> &gt; 1, the Riemann zeta function ζ(<em>s</em>) is defined byrn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"background-color: white;\" src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/riemann_zeta2.svg\" alt=\"zeta(s) = sum_{n=1}^infty frac{1}{n^s}\" /></p>rnWe dont have to limit ourselves to real numbers <em>s</em> &gt; 1; the definition holds for complex numbers <em>s</em> with real part greater than 1. Thatll be important below.rnrnWhen <em>s</em> is a positive even number, theres a formula for ζ(<em>s</em>) in terms of the Bernoulli numbers:rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"background-color: white;\" src=\"//johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/zeta_bernoulli.svg\" alt=\"\\zeta(2n) = (-1)^{n-1} 2^{2n-1} \\pi^{2n} \\frac{B_{2n}}{(2n)!}\" /></p>rnThe best-known special case of this formula is thatrn<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + … = π<sup>2</sup> / 6.</p>rnIts a famous open problem to find a closed-form expression for ζ(3) or any other odd argument.rnrnThe formula relating the zeta function and Bernoulli tells us a couple things about the Bernoulli numbers. First, for <em>n</em> ≥ 1 the Bernoulli numbers with index 2<em>n</em> alternate sign. Second, by looking at the sum defining ζ(2<em>n</em>) we can see that it is approximately 1 for large <em>n</em>. This tells us that for large <em>n</em>, |<em>B</em><sub>2<em>n</em></sub>| is approximately (2<em>n</em>)! / 2<sup>2<em>n</em><em>−</em>1</sup> π<sup>2<em>n</em></sup>.rnrnWe said above that the sum defining the Riemann zeta function is valid for complex numbers <em>s</em> with real part greater than 1. There is a unique analytic extension of the zeta function to the rest of the complex plane, except at <em>s</em> = 1. The zeta function is defined, for example, at negative integers, but the sum defining zeta in the half-plane Re(<em>s</em>) &gt; 1 is NOT valid.rnrnYou may have seen the equationrn<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1 + 2 + 3 + … = <em>−</em>1/12.</p>rnThis is an abuse of notation. The sum on the left clearly diverges to infinity. But if the sum defining ζ(<em>s</em>) for Re(<em>s</em>) &gt; 1 were valid for <em>s</em> = <em>−</em>1 (which it is not) then the left side would equal ζ(<em>−</em>1). The analytic continuation of ζ <em>is</em> valid at -1, and in fact ζ(<em>−</em>1) = <em>−</em>1/12. So the equation above is true if you interpret the left side, not as an ordinary sum, but as a way of writing ζ(<em>−</em>1). The same approach could be used to make sense of similar equations such asrn<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + … = 0</p>rnandrn<p style=\"text-align: center;\">1<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> + … = 1/120.</p>rn<strong>Related</strong>: <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/special-numbers/\">Posts on special numbers</a>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 482}

(\"Proving Investment Success Takes Time,\" Spencer Jakab, November 25, 2017.)rn<blockquote>Victor Haghani … and two colleagues told several hundred acquaintances who worked in finance that they would flip two coins, one that was normal and the other that was weighted so it came up heads 60% of the time. They asked the people how many flips it would take them to figure out, with a 95% confidence level, which one was the 60% coin. Told to give a “quick guess,” nearly a third said fewer than 10 flips, while the median response was 40. The correct answer is 143.</blockquote>rnThe anecdote is correct in spirit: it takes longer to discover the better of two options than most people suppose. But its jarring to read the answer is precisely 143 when the question hasnt been stated clearly.rnrnHow many flips would it take to figure out which coin is better with a 95% confidence level? For starters, the answer would have to be a distribution, not a single number. You might quickly come to the right conclusion. You <em>might</em> quickly come to the <em>wrong</em> conclusion. You might flip coins for a long time and never come to a conclusion. Maybe there is a way a formulating the problem so that so that the <em>expected value</em> of the distribution is 143.rnrnHow are you to go about flipping the coins? Do you flip both of them, or just flip one coin? For example, you might flip both coins until you are confident that one is better, and conclude that the better one is the one that was designed to come up heads 60% of the time. Or you could just flip one of them and test the hypothesis Prob(heads) = 0.5 versus the alternative Prob(heads) = 0.6. Or maybe you flip one coin two times for every one time you flip the other. Etc.rnrnWhat do you mean by \"95% confidence level\"? Is this a frequentist confidence interval? And do you compute the (Bayesian) predictive probability of arriving at such a confidence level? Are you computing the (Bayesian) posterior model probabilities of two models, one in which the first coin has probability of heads 0.5 and the second has probability 0.6 versus the opposite model?rnrnDo you assume that you know a priori that one coin has probability of heads 0.5 and the other 0.6, or do you not assume this and just want to find the coin with higher probability of heads, and evaluate such a model when in fact the probabilities of heads are as stated?rnrnAre you conducting an experiment with a predetermined sample size of 143? Or are you continuous monitoring the data, stopping when you reach your conclusion?rnrnI leave it as an exercise to the reader to implement the various alternatives suggested above and see whether one of them produces 143 as a result. (I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation that suggests there is one.) So the first question is to reverse engineer which problem statement the article was based on. The second question is to decide which problem formulation you believe would be most appropriate in the context of the article.", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 547}

This curve has a sibling, <strong>secp256r1</strong>. Note the \"r\" in the penultimate position rather than a \"k\". Both are defined in <a href=\"http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf\">SEC 2</a>: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters. Both are elliptic curves over a field <em>z</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> where <em>p</em> is a 256-bit prime (though different primes for each curve).rnrnThe \"k\" in sepc256k1 stands for <strong>Koblitz</strong> and the \"r\" in sepc256r1 stands for <strong>random</strong>. A Koblitz elliptic curve has some special properties that make it possible to implement the group operation more efficiently. It is believed that there is a small security trade-off, that more \"randomly\" selected parameters are more secure. However, some people suspect that the random coefficients may have been selected to provide a back door.rnrnBoth elliptic curves are of the form <em>y</em>² = <em>x</em>³ + <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em>.

It is also known as <abbr title=\"National Institute of Standards and Technology\">NIST</abbr> P-256. Or rather it <em>did</em> recommend P-256 as part of its Suite B of cryptography recommendations. In August 21015 the NSA <a href=\"https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/10/22/a-riddle-wrapped-in-curve/\">announced</a> its concern that in the future, quantum computing could render the Suite B methods insecure. As far as we know, quantum computing at scale is years, maybe decades, away. But it takes a long time to develop quality encryption methods, and so the NSA and NIST are urging people to think ahead. (Update: The NSA recommends <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2019/05/11/elliptic-curve-p-384/\">P-384</a> until post quantum methods mature.)rnrnBitcoin chose to use the less popular Koblitz curve for the reasons mentioned above, namely efficiency and concerns over a possible back door in the random curve.

This post is about the former. I help companies with <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/expert-hipaa-deidentification/\">the latter</a>.rn<h2>Safe Harbor provision</h2>rnThe Safe Harbor provision lists 18 categories of data (and an <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2023/10/20/hipaa-safe-harbor/\">implicit 19th category</a>) that would cause a data set to not be considered de-identified unless an expert determines the data does not pose a significant re-identification risk.rnrnSome of the items prohibited by Safe Harbor are obvious: telephone number, email address, social security number, etc. Others are not so obvious. In order for data to fall under the Safe Harbor provision, one must removern<blockquote>All elements of dates (except year) for dates that are directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, death date, and all ages over 89 …</blockquote>rnWhy are these dates a problem? Birth dates are clearly useful in identifying individuals; when combined with zip code and sex, they give enough information to uniquely identify 87% of Americans. (More details <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2018/03/02/bits-of-information-in-age-birthday-and-birthdate/\">here</a>.) But why admission or discharge dates?rn<h2>Public information on dates</h2>rnLatanya Sweeney demonstrated <a href=\"https://techscience.org/a/2015092903/\">here</a> how dates of hospital admission can be used to identify individuals. She purchased a set of anonymized health records for the state of Washington for 2011 and compared the records to newspaper stories. She simply did a LexusNexus search on the term \"hospitalized\" to find news stories about people who were hospitalized, then searched for the medical records for the personal details from the newspaper articles.rnrnIn the discussion section of her article Sweeney points out that although she searched newspapers, one could get similar information from other sources, such as employee leave records or from a record of someone asking to pay a bill late due to illness.rn<h2>Randomized dates</h2>rnThere are ways to retain the information in dates without jeopardizing privacy. For example, one could jitter the dates by adding a random offset. However, the way to do this depends on context and can be subtle. For example, Netflix jittered the dates in its Netflix Prize data set by +/- two weeks, but this was not enough to prevent a privacy breach [1]. And if you add too much randomness and the utility of the data degrades. Thats why the <abbr title=\"Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\">HIPAA</abbr> Privacy Rule includes the provision to obtain <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/expert-hipaa-deidentification/\">expert determination</a> that your procedures are adequate in your context.rn<h2>Related posts</h2>rn<ul>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2017/09/20/adding-laplace-or-gaussian-noise-to-database/\">Adding randomness for data privacy</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/expert-hipaa-deidentification/\">HIPAA expert determination</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/data-incident-breach-response/\">Data breach response</a></li>rn</ul>rn[1] Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov.

If this list is leaked, someone knows all the passwords with no effort.rn<h2>Better: hash values</h2>rnA better approach would be to run passwords through a secure hash function before storing them. The server would never store a password per se, only its hashed value. When someone enters a password, the server would check whether the hash of the password matches the stored hashed value. If the list of hashed values is leaked, it will take some effort to recover the original passwords, though maybe not much effort, as I wrote about in my <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2019/01/24/reversing-an-md5-hash/\">previous post</a>.rn<h2>Better still: add salt</h2>rnThe next step in sophistication is to append a random value, called a <strong>salt</strong>, to the password before applying the hash function. The server would store each users salt value and the hash of the password with the salt added.rnrnNow if the user has a naive password like \"qwerty\" you couldnt crack the password by doing a simple Google search. You can find the hash value of \"qwerty\" by searching, but not the hash value of qwerty + random salt, because although the former is common the latter is probably unique. You could still crack the password if the hash is insecure, but it would take a little effort.rn<h2>Better still: key stretching</h2>rnSuppose an attacker has a list of salt values and corresponding hash values for salt + password. They could guess passwords, hashing each with a salt value, to see if any hash values match. They would start with the <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2018/09/25/passwords-and-power-laws/\">most common passwords</a> and probably get some matches.rnrn<strong>Key stretching</strong> is a way to make this brute force search more time consuming by requiring repeated hashing. In the following stretching algorithm, <em>p</em> is the password, <em>s</em> is the salt, <em>h</em> is the hash function, and || means string concatenation.rnrn<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/salt_stretch.svg\" alt=\"begin{align*} x_0 &amp;= phi \\ x_i &amp;= h(x_{i-1} || p || s) mbox{ for i = 1, ldots, }r \\ K &amp;= x_r end{align*}\" width=\"259\" height=\"68\" style=\"background-color:white\" />rnrnNow the time required to test each password has been multiplied by <em>r</em>.

This problem starts with a finite set of real numbers <em>A</em> then considers the size of the sets <em>A</em>+<em>A</em> and <em>A</em>*<em>A</em>. That is, if we add every element of <em>A</em> to every other element of <em>A</em>, how many distinct sums are there? If we take products instead, how many distinct products are there?rn<h2>Proven results</h2>rnErdős and Szemerédi proved that there are constants <em>c</em> and ε &gt; 0 such thatrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">max{|<em>A</em>+<em>A</em>|, |<em>A</em>*<em>A</em>|} ≥ <em>c</em>|<em>A</em>|<sup>1+ε</sup></p>rnIn other words, either <em>A</em>+<em>A</em> or <em>A</em>*<em>A</em> is substantially bigger than <em>A</em>. Erdős and Szemerédi only proved that some positive ε exists, but they suspected ε could be chosen close to 1, i.e. that either |<em>A</em>+<em>A</em>| or |<em>A</em>*<em>A</em>| is bounded below by a fixed multiple of |<em>A</em>|² or nearly so. George Shakan later showed that one can take ε to be any value less thanrn<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">1/3 + 5/5277 = 0.3342899…</p>rnbut the conjecture remains that the upper limit on ε is 1.rn<h2>Python code</h2>rnThe following Python code will let you explore the sum-product conjecture empirically. It randomly selects sets of size <em>N</em> from the non-negative integers less than <em>R</em>, then computes the sum and product sets using set comprehensions.rn<pre>    from numpy.random import choicernrn    def trial(R, N):rn        # R = integer range, N = sample sizern        x = choice(R, N, replace=False)rn        s = {a+b for a in x for b in x}rn        p = {a*b for a in x for b in x}rn        return (len(s), len(p))rn</pre>rnWhen I first tried this code I thought it had a bug. I called <code>trial</code> 10 times and got the same values for |<em>A</em>+<em>A</em>| and |<em>A</em>*<em>A</em>| every time. That was because I chose <em>R</em> large relative to <em>N</em>. In that case, it is likely that every sum and every product will be unique, aside from the redundancy from commutativity. That is, if <em>R</em> &gt;&gt; <em>N</em>, it is likely that |<em>A</em>+<em>A</em>| and |<em>A</em>*<em>A</em>| will both equal <em>N</em>(<em>N</em>+1)/2. Things get more interesting when <em>N</em> is closer to <em>R</em>.rn<h2>Probability vs combinatorics</h2>rnThe Erdős-Szemerédi problem is a problem in combinatorics, looking for deterministic lower bounds. But it seems natural to consider a probabilistic extension. Instead of asking about <strong>lower bounds</strong> on |<em>A</em>+<em>A</em>| and |<em>A</em>*<em>A</em>| you could ask for the <strong>distribution</strong> on |<em>A</em>+<em>A</em>| and |<em>A</em>*<em>A</em>| when the sets <em>A</em> are drawn from some probability distribution.rnrnIf the set <em>A</em> is drawn from a continuous distribution, then |<em>A</em>+<em>A</em>| and |<em>A</em>*<em>A</em>| both equal <em>N</em>(<em>N</em>+1)/2 with probability 1. Only careful choices, ones that would happen randomly with probability zero, could prevent the sums and products from being unique, modulo commutativity, as in the case <em>R</em> &gt;&gt; <em>N</em> above.rnrnIf the set <em>A</em> is an arithmetic sequence then |<em>A</em>+<em>A</em>| is small and |<em>A</em>*<em>A</em>| is large, and the opposite holds if <em>A</em> is a geometric sequence. So it might be interesting to look at the correlation of |<em>A</em>+<em>A</em>| and |<em>A</em>*<em>A</em>| when <em>A</em> comes from a discrete distribution, such as choosing <em>N</em> integers uniformly from [1, <em>R</em>] when <em>N</em>/<em>R</em> is not too small.", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 501}

If you and someone else share a modulus <em>n</em>, you can use your (<em>e</em>, <em>d</em>) pair to factor <em>n</em>, and from knowing their public key <em>e</em> you can recover their private key <em>d</em>.rnrnDuplicate moduli cannot happen by chance.

Or all dimensions, even and odd?rnrnThe answers to all these questions are easy in terms of the <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2016/07/17/mittag-leffler-function-and-probability-distribution/\">Mittag-Leffler function</a> that I blogged about a while back. This function is defined asrnrn<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/ML2.svg\" alt=\"E_{alpha, beta}(x) = sum_{k=0}^infty frac{x^k}{Gamma(alpha k+beta)}\" width=\"180\" style=\"background-color:white\" />rnrnand reduces to the exponential function when α = β = 1.rnrnThe sum of the volumes of all unit spheres of all dimensions is <em>E</em><sub>1/2, 1</sub>(√π).

So the sum of all volumes of spheres is exp(π) erfc(-√π).rnrnNow erfc(-√π) ≈ 1.9878 and so this says the sum of the volumes of spheres of all dimensions is about twice the sum of the even dimensional spheres alone. And so the sum of the odd dimensional unit sphere volumes is almost the same as the sum of the even dimensional ones.rnrnBy the way, you could easily answer other questions about sums of sphere volumes in terms of the Mittag-Leffler function. For example, if you want to add up the volumes in all dimensions that are a multiple of 3, you get <em>E</em><sub>3/2, 1</sub>(π<sup>3/2</sup>).rn<h2>Related posts</h2>rn<ul>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2017/07/24/sphere-packing/\">Sphere packing</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2018/07/20/homotopy-groups-of-spheres/\">Homotopy groups of spheres</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2018/01/31/integrating-polynomials-over-a-sphere-or-ball/\">Integrating polynomials over a sphere</a></li>rn</ul>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 304}

Historically, integration came first and the rigorous definition of limits came last.rnrnI wanted to quote a short excerpt from the book discussing a manuscript of Archimedes. In 1906, Johan Heiberg discovered that a medieval prayer book had recycled vellum that had contained an account of the methods used by Archimedes to compute areas and volumes, a sort of proto-calculus book. Researchers were able to reconstruct much of the original text that had been scraped off in order to reuse the vellum.rnrnIn 2003 a <em>NOVA</em> documentary speculated that calculus could have been developed centuries earlier had the manuscript not been lost, and that technology would be far ahead of where it is now, and that \"We could have been on Mars today.\" rnrnBressoud does not agree.rnrn<blockquote>That is nonsense. As we shall see, Archimedes other works were perfectly sufficient to lead the way toward the development of calculus.

The curves add visual interest, but they use more material than a straight wall. Except they dont! They use more bricks than a straight wall <em>of the same</em> thickness but they dont have to be as thick.rnrnCrinkle crankle walls resist horizontal forces, like wind, more than straight wall would. So if the alternative to a crinkle crankle wall one-brick thick is a straight wall two or more bricks thick, the former saves material. How much material?rnrnThe amount of material used in the wall is proportional to the product of its length and thickness. Suppose the wall is shaped like a sine wave and consider a section of wall 2π long. If the wall is in the shape of <em>a</em> sin(θ), then we need to find the arc length of this curve. This works out to the following integral.rnrn<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/crinkle_length.svg\" alt=\"int_0^{2pi} sqrt{1 + a^2 cos^2(x)}, dx\" width=\"180\" height=\"44\" style=\"background-color:white\" />rnrnThe parameter <em>a</em> is the amplitude of the sine wave. If <em>a</em> = 0, we have a flat wave, i.e. a straight wall, as so the length of this segment is 2π = 6.2832. If <em>a</em> = 1, the integral is 7.6404. So a section of wall is 22% longer, but uses 50% less material per unit length as a wall two bricks thick.rnrnThe integral above cannot be computed in closed form in terms of elementary functions, so this would make a good homework exercise for a class covering numerical integration.rnrnThe integral can be computed in terms of special functions. It equals 4 <em>E</em>(-<em>a</em>²) where <em>E</em> is the \"complete elliptic integral of the second kind.\" This function is implemented as <code>EllipticE</code> in Mathematica and as <code>scipy.special.ellipe</code> in Python.rnrnAs the amplitude <em>a</em> increases, the arc length of a section of wall increases. You could solve for the value of <em>a</em> to give you whatever arc length you like. For example, if <em>a</em> = 1.4422 then the length is twice that of a straight line. So a crinkle crankle wall with amplitude 1.4422 uses about as many bricks as a straight wall twice as thick.rn<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>rnPhoto <span id=\"attribution\" class=\"photo_usage-attribution\" data-v-4370462c=\"\"><a href=\"//www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1259187\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"Crinkle crankle wall, Fulbourn\"</a> <span data-v-4370462c=\"\"> by <a href=\"https://geograph.org.uk/profile/636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bob Jones</a></span> is licensed under <a class=\"photo_license\" href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> CC BY-SA 2.0 </a></span>rn<p style=\"font-size: 0.9rem; font-style: italic;\"></p>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 414}

In particular, you can wrap a section of code with &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; and the levels of indentation will be retained.rnrnSometimes I see that someone has left a block of code wrapped between &lt;code&gt; and &lt;/code&gt; tags, but this doesnt do what they expected. Thats because &lt;code&gt; is an <em>inline</em> element and &lt;pre&gt; is a <em>block</em> element. The former can be used in the middle of a sentence, such as referring to the <code>qsort</code> function, but for multiple lines of code you need the latter.rnrnThe comment editor does not accept LaTeX markup, but you can write a fair amount of <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/math_symbols/\">mathematics with plain HTML</a>.rnrnThanks again for your comments.", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 173}

Is this always the case? If not, is it often the case?rnrnThe MathOverflow question was stated in terms of Hamming distance, counting the number of bits in which two bit sequences differ. It asked whether odd numbers are always Hamming distance 1 away from a prime. My restatement of the question asks whether the Hamming distance is always <em>at most</em> 1, or how often it is no more than 1.rnrnYou could ask more generally about the Hamming distance to the nearest prime. Is it bounded, if not by 1, then by another finite number? If so, what is the smallest such bound? What is the probability that its value is 1? Etc.rnrnThis ties into a couple of other things Ive blogged about. A <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2020/05/04/prime-plus-power-of-2/\">few weeks ago</a> I wrote about new work on the problem of finding the proportion of odd numbers that can be written as the sum of a power of 2 and a prime. Thats a little different problem since bit flipping is taking the XOR (exclusive or) and not always the same as addition. It also leaves out the possibility of flipping a bit beyond the most significant bit of the number, i.e. adding to a number <em>n</em> a power of 2 greater than <em>n</em>.rnrnAnother related post is on the <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2019/06/21/rowhammer/\">Rowhammer</a> attack on public key cryptography. By flipping a bit in the product of two primes, you can produce a number which is much easier to factor.rnrnThese two posts suggest a variation on the original problem where we disallow flipping bits higher than the most significant bit of <em>n</em>. So giving a <em>k</em>-bit number <em>n</em>, how often can we flip one of its <em>k</em> bits and produce a prime?rnrn[1] Note that the bit flipped may be higher than the most significant bit of the number, unless ruled out as in the paragraph above. Several people have asked \"What about 85?\" It is true that flipping any of the seven lowest bits of 85 will not yield a prime. But flipping a zero bit in a more significant position will give a prime. For example, 1024 + 85 is prime.

It would appear that li(<em>x</em>) is not only an approximation for π(<em>x</em>), but it is also an upper bound. That is, it seems that li(<em>x</em>) &gt; π(<em>x</em>). However, thats not true for all <em>x</em>.rnrnLittlewood proved in 1914 that there is some <em>x</em> for which π(<em>x</em>) &gt; li(<em>x</em>). We still dont know a specific number <em>x</em> for which this holds, though we know such numbers exist. The smallest such <em>x</em> is the definition of Skewes number. The number of digits in Skewes number is known to be between 20 and 317, and is believed to be close to the latter.rnrnLittlewood not only proved that li(<em>x</em>) − π(<em>x</em>) is sometimes negative, he proved that it changes sign infinitely often.

This trivial cross product only works in one dimension because there are no orthogonal unit vectors in one dimension.rnrnTo define his cross product in seven dimensions, Walsh partitions the seven components of a vector into groups of 3, 1, and 3 and treats the groups of size three as three dimensional vectors.

The boreholes curve around underground, even if the intent is to drill a perfectly straight hole. With horizontal drilling the curvature can be substantial.rnrnDogleg severity is calculated by measuring <strong>inclination</strong> and <strong>azimuth</strong> every 100 feet along a well. Inclination is the angle the hole makes with the vertical axis, like the angle φ in spherical coordinates, 90° minus the latitude. Azimuth is the angle of the projection of the well to a horizontal plane, like the θ or longitude angle in spherical coordinates. So if a well is nearly vertical, the inclination angles will be small. If a hole were shaped like a corkscrew, the inclination would be constant while the azimuth makes multiple rotations.rnrnWhen I said 100 feet along the well, that is 100 feet of arc length. If a hole were perfectly vertical, this would be a change of 100 vertical feet, but generally it is less. If a segment were perfectly horizontal, it would be a change of 100 horizontal feet with no change in vertical depth.rnrnDogleg severity models a section of an oil well as a piece of a big circle. We assume our two inclination and azimuth measurements taken at two points along this circle, separated by an arc of 100 feet. If this arc makes an angle ψ, then the length of the arc isrn<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">ρ ψ = 100 ft</p>rnwhere ρ is the radius of the circle. Engineers call the angle ψ the <strong>dog leg angle</strong>, the angle of the sector between two measurements. Mathematicians call 1/ρ the curvature, so curvature is proportional to DLS.rnrnTo calculate curvature or DLS you have to calculate ψ from the two inclination and azimuth readings, (θ<sub>1</sub>, φ<sub>1</sub>) and (θ<sub>2</sub>, φ<sub>2</sub>). This is exactly the same as <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/lat_long_details.html\">calculating distance from longitude and latitude</a>. Instead of longitude and latitude on the earth, imagine a large sphere tangent to the wellbore at the two points where the measurements were taken.

This is a powerlaw distribution on the positive integers with normalizing constant given by the Riemann zeta distribution. That is, the zeta distribution has densityrn<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>f</em>(<em>k</em>; <em>s</em>) = <em>k</em><sup>&minus;<em>s</em></sup> / ζ(<em>s</em>).</p>rnwhere <em>k</em> is a positive integer and <em>s</em> &gt; 1 is a fixed parameter.rnrnFor <em>s</em> &gt; 1, the zeta function is defined as the sum of the positive integers to the power negative <em>s</em>, so ζ(<em>s</em>) is essentially defined as the normalizing constant of the zeta distribution.rnrnI wanted to make a couple comments about this. First, it shows that the zeta function appears in applications outside of number theory. Second, when working with the zeta distribution, it would be useful to have an estimate for ζ(<em>s</em>).rn<h2>Zeta function bounds</h2>rnThe integral <em>test</em> in calculus is typically presented as a way to test whether an infinite sum converges. This is a shame. In analysis as in statistics, <strong>estimation is better than testing</strong>. Testing throws away continuous information and replaces it with a single bit.rnrnLet <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) be a decreasing function; we have in mind <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 1/<em>x</em><sup><em>s</em></sup>.

Typically <em>n</em> will be small, maybe 0 or 1.

The lowest note on a standard piano, the A below C1, is A0.rnrnAt one point in time C0 was defined to be exactly 16 Hz. The frequencies of notes have been defined slightly differently across time and location.rnrnMathematically perfect octaves, however, don’t sound quite right. The highest notes on a piano would sound flat if every octave were exactly twice the frequency of the previous octave. So we tune the lowest notes a little lower than the math would say to, and the high notes higher.</blockquote>rnIn the original thread I said that C0 was the lowest C on a piano when I should have said C1.rnrnNo discussion of mathematics and piano tuning would be complete without mentioning Fermi problems.

The two alefs appear substantially different.rnrnNote that the mathematical symbol alef is a left-to-right character and the Hebrew latter alef is a right-to-left character.

My org file looked like this:rn<pre>    #+begin_src python :session :exports nonern    lax_lat =   33.94rn    lax_lon = -118.41rn    iah_lat =   29.98rn    iah_lon =  -95.34rn    #+end_srcrnrn    Suppose we want to find how far a plane would travel rn    between Los Angeles (LAX) and Houston (IAH), rn    ...rnrn    #+begin_src python :session :exports nonern    a = round(90 - lax_lat, 2)rn    b = round(90 - iah_lat, 2)rn    #+end_srcrnrn    /a/ = src_python[:session :results raw]{f\"90° – {lax_lat}° = {a}°\"}rnrn    andrnrn    /b/ = src_python[:session :results raw]{f\"90° – {iah_lat}° = {b}°\"}rnrn    ...rn</pre>rnHere are some observations about the experience.rnrnFirst of all, writing the post in org-mode was <strong>more work</strong> than writing it directly, pasting in computed values by hand, but presumably <strong>less error-prone</strong>. It would also be easier to update. If, for example, I realized that I had the wrong coordinates for one of the airports, I could update the coordinates in one location and everything else would be updated when I regenerated the page.rnrnI dont think this was the best application of org-mode. Its easier to use org-mode like a <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2022/08/02/org-babel-vs-jupyter/\">notebook</a>, in which case youre not trying to hide the fact that youre mixing code and prose. I wanted to <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2022/08/03/inline-org-babel/\">insert computed values</a> into the text without calling attention to the fact that the values were computed. This is fine when you mostly have a text document and you only want to insert a few computed values. When youre doing more computing it becomes tedious to repeatedly writern<pre>    src_python[:session :results raw]{...}</pre>rnto insert values. It might have been easier in this case to simply write a Python program that printed out the HTML source of the example.rnrnThere are <strong>a couple advantages</strong> to org-mode that werent relevant here. One is that the same org-mode file can be exported to <strong>multiple formats</strong>: HTML, LaTeX, ODT, etc. Here, however, I was only interested in exporting to HTML.rnrnAnother advantage of org-mode is the ability to <strong>mix multiple programming languages</strong>. Here I was using Python for everything, but org-mode will let you mix dozens of languages. You could compute one result in R, another result in Haskell, pass both results as arguments into some Java code, etc. You could also include <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2022/08/15/org-table-python/\">data tables</a> and <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2020/07/25/worst-tool-for-the-job/\">diagrams</a> in your org-mode file with your prose and code.rn<h2>Literate programming</h2>rnIn general, keeping code and documentation together reduces errors. Literate programming may be more or less work, depending on the problem, but it reduces certain kinds of errors.rnrnThe example above is sorta bargain-basement literate programming. The code being developed was very simple, and not of interest beyond the article it was used in. Literate programming really shines when used to develop complex code, as in the book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3AUpu9k\">Physically Based Rendering</a>. (<b>Update</b>: The third edition of this book is available <a href=\"https://pbr-book.org/\">online</a>.)rnrn<strong>When code requires a lot of explanation</strong>, literate programming can be very helpful. I did a project in <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/psychoacoustics-consulting/\">psychoacoustics</a> with literate programming a few years ago that would have been hard to do any other way. The project required a lot of reverse engineering and research. A line of code could easily require a couple paragraphs of explanation. Literate programming made the code development much easier because we could develop the documentation and code together, explaining things in the order most suited to the <strong>human reader</strong>, not to the compiler.", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 585}

The corresponding formulas for hyperbolic space <strong>mostly</strong> just replace circular functions with hyperbolic functions, i.e. replace sine with hyperbolic sine and cosine with hyperbolic cosine.rnrnTriangles on a sphere or on a hyperbolic space like a pseudosphere have two kinds of angles: the sides come together at an angle, but the sides themselves are angles. By convention, the former are denoted with upper case letters and the latter with lower case letters.rnrnThe translation rule from spherical to hyperbolic geometry is to change functions of sides from circular to hyperbolic, but to leave functions of intersection angles alone. Or in typographical terms, put an <em>h</em> on the end of functions of a lower case letter but not functions of a upper case letter.rnrnYou can find these formulas, for example, in [1].rn<h2>Hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem</h2>rnThe Pythagorean theorem on a spherern<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">cos(<em>c</em>) = cos(<em>a</em>) cos(<em>b</em>).</p>rnbecomesrn<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">cosh(<em>c</em>) = cosh(<em>a</em>) cosh(<em>b</em>)</p>rnin hyperbolic geometry.

When there are two factors being tested, the combinations of the two factors are chosen according to the following diagram, with the value at the center being used for several replications, say four.rnrn<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/grid_ccd.png\" alt=\"CCD grid\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" />rnrnThe variables are coded so that the corners of the square have both coordinates equal to ±1.

The radial direction in the plot above shows the angle down from the North Pole rather than the angle up from the equator.rnrnSo if our flight of constant bearing keeps going rather than stopping at Jerusalem, it will spiral quickly toward the North Pole. It appears to stop at pole unless you look carefully. In theory the spiral keeps going and never actually reaches the pole. This is easy to see on the Mercator map because the North Pole is infinitely far away on the vertical axis.rn", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 255}

This post presents another analog of Napoleons theorem for quadrilaterals.rnrnNapoleaons theorem says that if you start with any triangle, and attach equilateral triangles to each side, the centroids of these new triangles are the vertices of an equilateral triangle.rnrnSo if you attach squares to the sides of a quadrilateral, are their centroids the vertices of a square? In general no.rnrnBut you can attach squares to two sides, and special rectangles to the other two sides, and the centroids will form the corners of a square.

This post will do the same for <strong>Major League Baseball</strong>.rnrnLike the NFL, MLB teams are organized into a nice tree structure, though the MLB tree is a little more complicated. There are 32 NFL teams organized into a complete binary tree, with a couple levels collapsed. There are 30 MLB teams, so the tree structure has to be a bit different.rnrnMLB has <strong>leagues</strong> rather than conferences, but the top-level division is into American and Nation as with the NFL. So the top division is into the American League and the National League.rnrnAnd as with football, the next level of the hierarchy is <strong>divisions</strong>. But baseball has three divisions—East, Central, and West—in contrast to four in football.rnrnEach division has five baseball teams, while each football division has four teams.rnrnHeres the basic tree structure.rnrn<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" src=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/mlb.png\" width=\"476\" height=\"166\" />rnrnUnder each division are five teams.

But essentially the East, Central, and West divisions do correspond to geographic east, center, and west, within a league.rn<h2>Numbering</h2>rnWe cant number baseball teams as elegantly as the previous post numbered football teams. Wed need a mixed-base number. The leading digit would be binary, the next digit base 3, and the final digit base 5.rnrnWe could number the teams so that you could tell the league and division of the team by looking at the remainders when the number is divided by 2 and 3, and each team is unique mod 5. By the <a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2008/12/11/constructive-proof-chinese-remainder-theorem/\">Chinese Remainder Theorem</a>, we can solve the system of congruence equations mod 30 that specify the value of a number mod 2, mod 3, and mod 5.rnrnIf we number the teams as follows, then even numbered teams are in the American League and odd numbered teams are in the National League. When the numbers are divided by 3, those with remainder 0 are in an Eastern division, those with remainder 1 are in a Central division, and those with remainder 2 are in a Western division.

This information can be useful to the photographer, but it could also pose a privacy risk. Before posting a photo publicly, you might want to strip out the metadata.rnrnAs I noted in the previous post, the privacy risk from data depends on context.

These costs are expected to trend to billions of dollars over the next few years [1]. One of the biggest computational expenses of LLM training is multiplying matrices. These are simple operations of the form <em>C</em> = <em>AB</em>. Matrix multiplies are common not only in AI model training but also many high performance computing applications from diverse science domains.rnrnEking out more speed from matrix multiplies could reduce AI model training costs by millions of dollars. More routinely, such improvements could reduce training runtime by hours on a single GPU-powered workstation or cut down cloud service provider expenses significantly.rnrnWhat is less well-known is that matrix multiples run on graphics processing units (GPUs) that are typically used for model training have many exotic performance behaviors that can drastically reduce matrix multiply efficiency by a wide margin.rnrnTwo recent works [2], [3] examine these phenomena in considerable depth. Factors such as matrix size, alignment of data in memory, power throttling, math library versions, chip-level manufacturing variability, and even the values of the matrix entries can significantly affect performance. At the same time, much of this variability can be modeled by machine learning methods such as decision trees and random forests [2].rnrnUse of these methods can be the first step toward implementing autotuning techniques to minimize costs. Using such methods or carefully applying rules of thumb for performance optimization can make a huge performance difference for matrix multiply-heavy GPU software.rn<h2>Related posts</h2>rn<ul>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2010/01/20/ten-surprises-from-numerical-linear-algebra/\">10 surprises from numerical linear algebra</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2022/07/15/gaussian-elimination/\">Gaussian elimination</a></li>rn \t<li class=\"link\"><a href=\"https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2015/12/07/linear-algebra/\">It all boils down to linear algebra</a></li>rn</ul>rn[1] <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2023/09/08/what-large-models-cost-you--there-is-no-free-ai-lunch/?sh=29709a604af7\">What large models cost you—there is no free AI lunch</a>rnrn[2] Wayne Joubert, Eric Palmer and Verónica G.

We know theyre different—James Bond isnt Agent 7—and yet the distinction isnt quite trivial.rnrnHow should software handle the two kinds of numbers? The answer isnt as simple as \"Do what the user expects\" because different users have different expectations.rn<h2>Excel</h2>rnIf you type 007 into Excel, by default the software will respond as if to say \"Got it. Seven.\" If you configure a cell to be text, then it will retain the leading zeros. Many people find this surprising, myself included.rnrnBut you can be sure that Microsoft has good reasons for the default behaviors it chooses. These are often business reasons rather than technical reasons. Microsoft wants to please the majority of its user base, not tech wizards. Not only are wizards an unprofitable minority, wizards can take care of themselves.rn<h2>Zip codes</h2>rnSomeone relayed the following conversation to me recently.rn<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\"It took me longer than I thought, but I got the zip codes wrangled.\"</p>rn<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\"Leading zeros trip you up?\"</p>rn<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\"Yeah, how did you guess?\"</p>rn<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\"This isnt my 01st rodeo.\"</p>rnIve run into this, as has almost everyone who has ever worked with zip codes. The Boston zip code 02134 is not the number 2,134.rn<h2>Octal</h2>rnIn Perl the expression <code>(02134 &gt; 2000)</code> evaluates to false. That is because in some software, including the perl interpreter, a leading zero indicates that a number is written in octal, i.e. base 8. So 02134 represents 2134<sub>eight</sub> = 1116<sub>ten</sub>, which is less than 2000<sub>ten</sub>.rnrn<strong>Update</strong>: Id forgotten that C acts the same way until Wayne reminded me in the comments.  I dont think Ive ever (deliberately) used that feature in C.rn<h2>Dates</h2>rnIm an American, and I use American-style dates in public correspondence. But privately I use YYYY-MM-DD dates so that dates always sort as intended, regardless of whether a particular piece of software interprets these symbols as numbers, text, or dates.rn<h2>Computer science versus software engineering</h2>rnFrom a computer science perspective, the root of the problem is not being explicit about data types. In computer science lingo, 7 and 2134 are integers, while 007 and 02134 are \"words\" built on the \"alphabet\" consisting of the digits 0 through 9. Integers and words have different data types. Furthermore, 007 and 02134 are not just words but representations of different data types: one is a serial number and the other is a postal code. And neither is not an octal number.rnrnObjects of different data types have may have similar text representations, but these representations are to be interpreted differently. And they have different sort orders, which may not correspond to their sort order as text. End of discussion.rnrnThis is fine for computer science, but it doesnt address the software engineering problem of meeting user expectations. It will not do to say \"Just make the user specify his types.\" The average user doesnt know what that means.rnrnSo what do you do? The software could make educated guesses, but then what? Ask the user for confirmation that the software guessed correctly? Or presume the guess was correct but provide a way to fix the assumption in case it was not? Demand that the user be more specific? The solution depends on context.rnrnEven if you want to meet the expectations of a particular group, such as Excel users or Perl programmers, those expectations may evolve over time.

This work was practical rather than mathematically elegant, useful in its time but not of long-term interest. However, one result came out of this work that I would call elegant, and that was a symmetry I found.rnrnLet <em>X</em> be a beta(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) random variable and let <em>Y</em> be a beta(<em>c</em>, <em>d</em>) random variable. Let <em>g</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>) be the probability that a sample from <em>X</em> is larger than a sample from <em>Y</em>.rn<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>g</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>) = Prob(<em>X</em> &gt; <em>Y</em>)</p>rnThis function often appeared in the inner loop of a simulation and so we spent thousands of CPU-hours computing its values. I looked for ways to evaluate this function more quickly, and along the way I found a symmetry.rnrnThe function I call <em>g</em> was studied by W. R. Thompson in 1933 [1]. Thompson noted two symmetries:rn<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>g</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>) = 1 − <em>g</em>(<em>c</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>)</p>rnandrn<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>g</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>) = <em>g</em>(<em>d</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>a</em>)</p>rnI found an additional symmetry:rn<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>g</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>) = <em>g</em>(<em>d</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>a</em>).</p>rnThe only reference to this result in a journal article as far as I know is a paper I wrote with Saralees Nadarajah [2].

If the list is long enough, the encrypted name that occurs most often probably corresponds to Smith. The second most common encrypted name probably corresponds to Johnson, and so forth. This kind of inference is analogous to solving a cryptogram puzzle by counting letter frequencies.rnrnThe probability of correctly guessing the most common names based on frequency analysis depends critically in the sample size. In a small sample, there may be no Smiths. In a larger sample, the name Smith may be common, but not the most common.rnrnI did some simulations to estimate how well frequency analysis would work at identifying the 10 most common names as a function of the sample size <em>N</em>. For each <em>N</em>, I simulated 100 data sets using probabilities derived from the surname frequencies derived from US Census Bureau data.rnrnWhen <em>N</em> = 1,000, there was a 53% chance that the most common name in the population, Smith, would be the most common name in the sample. The second most common name in the population, Johnson, was the second most common name in the sample only 14% of the time.rnrnWhen <em>N</em> = 10,000, there was a 94% chance of identifying Smith, and at least a 30% chance of identifying the five most common names.rnrnWhen <em>N</em> = 1,000,000, the three most common names were identified every time in the simulation. And each of the 10 most common names were correctly identified most of the time. In fact, the 18 most common names were correctly identified most of the time.rnrnA consequence of this analysis is that hashing names does not protect privacy if the sample size is large. Hashing names along with other information, so that the combined data has a more uniform distribution, may protect privacy.rnrn<h2>Related posts</h2>rn<ul>rn<li class=link><a href=https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2023/11/22/database-reconstruction-attacks/>Database reconstruction attacks</a></li>rn<li class=link><a href=https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/2024/01/05/five-safes/>Five safes framework</a></li>rn<li class=link><a href=https://johndcook1.wpenginepowered.com/blog/data-privacy/>Data privacy consulting</a></li>rn</ul>", "excerpt": "", "word_count": 313}
