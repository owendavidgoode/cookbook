twitter,"John runs a constellation of 20+ topic-specific Twitter accounts: @AlgebraFact, @CompSciFact, @ProbFact, @AnalysisFact, @RegexTip, @UnixToolTip, @DataSciFact, @SciPyTip, and more — a syndication network for mathematical microcontent."
twitter,"The @AlgebraFact account alone is referenced in 38 blog posts — John's topic-specific Twitter accounts serve as bidirectional bridges between microcontent and deep dives."
twitter,"John's Twitter strategy: atomize knowledge into domain-specific accounts, each attracting specialists, then link back to the blog for depth. It's content arbitrage across attention spans."
scholar,"Google Scholar reports 5,881 citations for John D. Cook — academic impact that rivals many full-time professors, achieved largely outside academia."
scholar,"32 peer-reviewed publications spanning Bayesian Analysis, Biometrics, Statistics in Medicine, and Clinical Trials — plus 13 MD Anderson working papers."
scholar,"John's most-cited work is on Bayesian clinical trial design — the intersection of mathematical rigor and life-or-death medical decisions."
scholar,"From 2000-2013 at MD Anderson Cancer Center: 13 years of Bayesian statistics, adaptive clinical trials, and numerical algorithm development before going independent."
code,"Python appears in 731 posts (14% of all content) — the blog's lingua franca since roughly 2015, replacing Perl's earlier dominance."
code,"Mathematica/Wolfram appears in 782 posts — steady presence since 2008, the workhorse for symbolic computation and visualization."
code,"Perl appears in 147 posts, concentrated in 2008-2014. Python appears in 731. The 5:1 ratio marks a generational shift in mathematical computing."
code,"R appears in 203 posts — the statistical computing specialist, often appearing alongside Python in data analysis contexts."
code,"Julia appears in only 3 posts — a notable absence for a language designed for scientific computing. John bet on Python."
code,"LaTeX appears in 783 posts — nearly every mathematical post uses it. The blog is essentially a LaTeX rendering engine with commentary."
code,"JavaScript appears in 39 posts, mostly for interactive calculators and visualizations — the tools that drive 98% of search traffic."
code,"C/C++ appears in 89 posts, concentrated in cryptography and numerical methods — when performance matters more than readability."
code,"The code language trajectory: Perl (2008-2012) → Python (2013-present), with Mathematica as the constant mathematical backbone throughout."
code,"2015 was the Python inflection point: mentions jumped 3x from 2014, coinciding with the data science boom and pandas/numpy maturity."
code,"Shell/Bash appears in 156 posts — Unix philosophy runs deep, with dedicated accounts @UnixToolTip and @SedAwkTip."
code,"SQL appears in only 23 posts — surprisingly low for a data-focused blog. John prefers in-memory computation to database queries."
code,"Assembly language appears in exactly 0 posts — the abstraction floor is C, never lower."
mathematician,"Euler appears in 124 posts — the most-referenced mathematician, spanning combinatorics, analysis, number theory, and graph theory."
mathematician,"Gauss appears in 55 posts — number theory, statistics, and the Gaussian distribution that bears his name."
mathematician,"Ramanujan appears in 34 posts — the romantic figure of mathematics, known for inexplicable identities and pattern recognition."
mathematician,"Fourier appears in 65 posts — signal processing's founding father, essential to DSP and harmonic analysis content."
mathematician,"Riemann appears in 47 posts — complex analysis, the zeta function, and geometry all trace back to him."
mathematician,"Cauchy appears in 31 posts — the rigorous analyst whose sequences and integrals underpin modern analysis."
mathematician,"Hilbert appears in 18 posts — function spaces, the axiomatization of geometry, and mathematical formalism."
mathematician,"Lagrange appears in 28 posts — optimization, mechanics, and interpolation all carry his name."
mathematician,"The mathematician hierarchy: Euler (124) > Fourier (65) > Gauss (55) > Riemann (47) > Ramanujan (34) > Cauchy (31) > Lagrange (28) > Hilbert (18)."
mathematician,"Living mathematicians mentioned: Terence Tao (15+ posts), Donald Knuth (12+ posts), Timothy Gowers (5+ posts) — the blog engages with contemporary mathematics."
tools,"The interpolation calculator alone drives 538,000+ clicks over 16 months — one HTML tool outperforms thousands of blog posts combined."
tools,"80+ standalone calculator and reference pages exist alongside 5,233 blog posts — infrastructure-as-content that compounds over time."
tools,"The Bessel functions reference page (created ~2010) is still actively linked 15 years later — true evergreen infrastructure."
tools,"Tools vs posts traffic ratio: 98% of Google search traffic goes to tools, 59% to blog posts (with overlap) — the calculators are the discovery engine."
evergreen,"5,233+ internal links create a knowledge graph where any concept can be traced back 15+ years without leaving the site."
evergreen,"Posts from 2010-2015 are still regularly linked from 2024-2025 content — the blog builds on itself rather than replacing itself."
evergreen,"The most internally-linked posts cluster around: Bayesian fundamentals, special functions (Gamma, Beta, Bessel), and probability distributions."
engagement,"Comment sections were disabled years ago — John chose depth over engagement metrics, writing over community management."
engagement,"The blog has no ads, no newsletter popups, no cookie banners — pure content, supported by consulting revenue."
meta,"From academic postdoc to independent consultant: John left MD Anderson in 2013 after 13 years to start Singular Value Consulting."
meta,"The blog predates Twitter (2008 vs 2006 Twitter launch) — John was blogging mathematics before social media was mainstream."
meta,"17 years of continuous publication without a gap longer than 12 days (Feb 13-26, 2025) — more reliable than most journals' publication schedules."
